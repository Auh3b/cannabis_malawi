The United States Cannabis Association (USCA) has committed $10 million (about K8.2 billion) to the purchase of industrial hemp, from some 50 licensed cooperatives across the country.
The association is expected to purchase 229,000 metric tonnes of the commodity yearly to be processed for different purposes in the United States.
In an interview, USCA Chief Executive Officer Wezi Ngalamira said the association will be buying cannabis at $80 per kilogramme for flowers and $2 per kilogramme for the grain.

“We are not middlemen but we are here to provide a guaranteed market which will purchase the leaf for processing. When we harvest flowers, we have already started the processing phase; therefore, the country’s industry will also benefit greatly,” Ngalamira said.
Womeecin Mulanje Farmers Limited Treasurer Robisa Inglis said they have been fully equipped with knowledge on cultivation of the crop and hopes to maximise earnings from the same.
“This ready market provided by USCA has increased our confidence to cultivate cannabis in high volumes. At first, we did not know who would buy our crop when we cultivate it but now we are glad that the buyers are ready to buy us at good prices,” Inglis said.

CHONGWE—We hope that the figures we are getting from other countries will be a benchmark
One of the cannabis buyers, United States Cannabis Association (Usca), has hinted that one hectare of cannabis could fetch up to K180 million from an investment of around K25 million to K30 million on a hectare.
The cannabis buyer said the cost analysis is based on prices sourced from countries such as Lesotho which is doing well with the crop.
Usca Director of Operations Oliver Ndhlovu said, if properly cultivated, farmers could produce around eight to 10 tonnes of cannabis per hectare and get around $5,000 per kilogramme.

Ndhlovu made the remarks on Tuesday in Mzimba District during a land verification exercise of cannabis fields of cooperatives, companies and partnerships who have registered to plant the crop this year.
“We are doing our own analysis as Malawi. We are working with Cannabis Regulatory Authority (CRA), Ministry of Agriculture and Invergro, which is an experienced company dealing with cannabis,” he said.
Figures show that, for one hectare, farmers require K8.8 million for a packet of 20,000 seeds.

On the onset, farmers require cultivation, processing or transportation lincence, police clearance, a greenhouse at the farm, reliable water source, labour and security plan that would prevent access to industrial hemp premises by unauthorised persons.
Meanwhile, some farmers have started raising fears over what they describe as stiff regulations in the cultivation of the leaf.
One of the farmers, Paul Chongwe, who is Chairperson of the United Organic Producers Cooperative, said most farmers were still not aware how much the commodity could be fetching.
The cooperative has 105 members, three farms, with 155 cumulative hectares.
“We are also still looking at what a hectare might bring in terms of rewards. But since the crop is new in Malawi, we hope that the figures we are getting from other countries will be a benchmark for us,” he said.
Malawi legalised cultivation of industrial and medicinal Cannabis Sativa in July 2020 which saw the establishment of CRA to regulate the cannabis industry as provided for in the Cannabis Regulation Act 2020.

Minister for cannabis production legalisation

Lobin Lowe
Minister of Agriculture Lobin Lowe has indicated that his ministry plans to ask Parliament to amend some laws to allow production of local cannabis varieties to maximise export earnings.
This comes at a time the country has been debating over a recent conviction of an 18-year-old boy in Blantyre who was found in possession of cannabis and handed an eight-year jail term.
However, the cannabis Regulation Act 2020 promotes production of Cannabis only for medicinal, industrial and scientific use and does not in any manner advocate, authorise, promote or legally or socially accept the use of cannabis for recreational uses.

In an interview on the side-lines of a visit to commercial tobacco growers in the Southern Region, Lowe said, as Parliament meets this July, issues prohibiting production of the local varieties will be discussed.
“There was a lot of hype when we introduced production of industrial hemp such that we thought most farmers will drop growing regular tobacco to this variety; unfortunately, cannabis is also market-oriented just like tobacco. Unless we get demand, that is when we know how much to produce. So, the demand we have as a starting point is just too little.
“We are trying to promote some investors and off-takers to come to Malawi to make sure that whatever we produce is all bought. We also talked about our local variety and there are issues with our laws. Come July, once Parliament meets, we should be able to sort out issues in the Act to make sure that our local variety is also produced,” Lowe said.

In a recent interview, the ministry’s spokesperson Grecian Lungu indicated that the research department was tasked to look into the necessities of producing the local variety widely.
“There is progress as collection of strains of our local cannabis is on-going, but I cannot confirm as to when the studies will be concluded,” Lungu said.
In an interview, agriculturalist Leonard Chimwaza wondered about the aim of legalising production of local cannabis varieties claiming the economic value could be the same as that of industrial hemp.
“While conducting research, there is a need to incorporate stakeholders from various sectors such as those from the health ministry, the police and other necessary sectors; they should not only focus on the economic value. Also, does it mean that the local cannabis varieties are more economical than industrial hemp? So what are their assumptions and what is the composition of the research committee? That is crucial,” Chimwaza said.

Head of Chemistry Department, John Kamanula, told the local media that the university was working with the Cannabis Regulatory Authority (CRA) and other stakeholders in the research project.

Kamanula added that most of the chemicals used when testing the cannabis varieties are very expensive and that the university needs enough support.
“They are bringing different varieties of cannabis and then for them to know the one that is marketable, you have to do the chemistry. Based on the chemistry, then they can know the quality of the varieties they have that can fetch the market prices,” explained Kamanula.
The research is also involving Chemistry students at the university and one company working with the university has called for collaboration in raising awareness on cannabis and its potential to national development.
Chief Executive Officer, Tania Clerk, emphasised the importance of the research.
“We should put aside some funding and engage the academia to access what role they can play in the development of the industry. We have to recognise that this is something that has to be nurtured,” remarked Clerk.
Malawi passed and accented the Cannabis Act in 2020.

Invegrow Limited, a company that was established in 2013 designed to grow and process Industrial Hemp in the country, plans to start commercial growing of the crop this year.
A South Africa based Canadian cannabis investor Graham Macntosh from Green Quest Pharmaceuticals said Malawi is losing out in cannabis trade.
He said Green Quest Pharmaceuticals is looking for 50 000 hectare of land to grow the industrial hemp used in the manufacturing of certain goods including clothes as well as medicine.
“Everyone should be allowed to grow cannabis without any legal impingements from a small one hectare to 101 hectare of land,” he said.
The cannabis investor said industrial hemp can take over tobacco as the largest forex earner, saying tobacco is now facing smoky future whilst cannabis faces bright future in investments.
Macntosh said currently, cannabis is a US$7 billion investment worldwide, saying within a year, it is expected to grow to US$10 billion.
Ntchisi north MP Boniface Kadzamira said although parliament legalized the testing of industrial hemp, which have since been done at Chitedze Research Station in Lilongwe and Chitala in Salima, cannabis remains illegal in Malawi.
He said to push the legalization on fast track, the government can put in regulations to allow people grow industrial hemp and investors get licence to buy the cannabis from Malawian farmers.
While cultivation or selling of cannabis sativa is prohibited by law, government says the industrial hemp will help boost the economy.
Industrial hemp and marijuana are from the same family of crops but industrial hemp does not contain the psychoactive chemical agents found in marijuana.
Meanwhile, Invegrow Limited, a company that was established in 2013 designed to grow and process Industrial Hemp in the country, plans to start commercial growing of the crop this year.
The firm, which has been working with government to research the viability of hemp as a commercial crop, has started mobilising resources for its factory in Lilongwe.
“Industrial hemp has more economic opportunities as we will be extracting the oil for fibre from the seed and produce oil products and it is also edible,” said Director at Invegrow Limited, Nebert Nyirenda, who adds that last year, the company imported body wash, shampoo and face wash with hemp seed oil just to give Malawians a feel of the products from Industrial Hemp.

Cannabis licencing fees under review
Times News

Betchani Tchereni
By Thabi Kamwangala:
The Cannabis Regulatory Authority (CRA) has said it will review industrial hemp licencing fees at its next board meeting.
This comes as local potential investors have been lamenting over the issue of ‘exorbitant’.

The industrial hemp licencing fee stands at K1.7 million including a non-refundable processing fee of K500, 000 while the medicinal hemp licencing fee is K9 million, with a non-refundable processing fee of K1 million.
CRA Board Chairperson Boniface Kadzamira said in an interview that the review is part of the board’s top agenda for its next meeting.
“We noted that, when we released the fees, people complained, saying that the fees are too high. As such, we have taken the complaints into consideration and we will be reviewing them soon.

“We must point out that we will only review the industrial hemp licencing fees and not medicinal licencing fees,” Kadzamira said
He said the nature of medicinal hemp was taken into account when considering the fees.
“It is difficult to reduce medicinal hemp licencing fees because, if abused, it could have negative effects. So, we will not review this [fee] until we review if people will stick to the agreements; whereas for industrial hemp, it can be treated as an agricultural plant.” He said
Meanwhile, CRA and some players in the industry have said that Cannabis has potential to contribute substantially to national economic development.
Founder of Invegrow, a local medicinal and industrial cannabis producer, Tanya Clarke, said the industry has great potential.
“For most people, there is still a misconception about the crop but it is important to make people aware that there are different products, both medicinal and industrial, that can be made from the product. It is not just for smoking. So, there is certainly a need for awareness and sensitisation on the crop,” he said.
Economist from the Malawi University of Business and Applied Sciences Betchani Tchereni said, as the economy faces forex woes, intensified production of alternative export crops such as cannabis remains ideal.
“Improved cannabis industry would mean more foreign exchange, more jobs and industrialisation for the country. So it is a huge opportunity,” he said.
Parliament enacted the Cannabis Act in February 2020, after seven years of attempts to get it up and running. In April 2020, the bill was assented to and in September 2020 the CRA was formulated.

He looks likely to hold onto that power by any means necessary. He’s refused to fire Malawi Electoral Commission commissioners, he’s refused to ratify bills that would allow a new election to take place, and he’s fired the commander of the defense force and the entire cabinet. There is significant political feeling against him in the country, but for now at least it appears that he’ll be staying in his position whether people like him or not.
Malawi looks to industrial hemp crop to increase foreign earnings
Even if we assume that he’ll be able to hold onto his position in the short term, though, he will eventually come to a point where elections need to be held, and his ultimate fate will be placed into the hands of the people. If that election were held today, the overwhelming majority of polls suggest he’d lose and lose badly. Could anything happen between now and the eventual date of the next election to change that, though?
What could the President do to get the public behind him, and increase his chances of staying in office? Could the decision to legalize cannabis in Malawi that was taken last month ultimately prove to be the one that saves him?
Over the course of the past year, we’ve seen Malawi open itself up to new sources of income associated with habits that people have long seen as vices. Cannabis use is one. Gambling is another. Late last year, the Malawi Gaming Board began to accept proposals for new casinos in the country in a move that could eventually see the legalization of online slots websites in Malawi.
The existing laws that govern gambling in the country are unclear, and so although citizens have access to online slots UK, nobody knows whether or not anyone’s breaking the law by playing them. By opening up more casinos and making the legality of those online slots websites clear, Malawi could make billions of Kwacha every year. That would be a great boost to the economy – but the boost that may come from sales of medicinal marijuana could be even bigger.
It’s unfair to compare Malawi to the United States of America due to the difference in size between the countries, and the vast differences between the Malawian economy and the American economy. We can, however, look at the effect that legalizing cannabis in certain states has had in the USA. The state of Colorado alone passed one billion dollars in revenue from marijuana sales in the middle of last year, and that figure is thought to have increased significantly since.
Some estimates from respectable forecasters suggest that by the end of 2023, the total revenue from all cannabis sales in the USA will have passed thirty billion dollars. Such a figure is unthinkable for Malawi, but the numbers don’t have to be that high for there to be a clear and obvious boost to the economy at home.
A healthy economy isn’t everything when it comes to the popularity of a President, or for the prospects of that President successfully standing for election, but it definitely helps. When there’s more money in the public purse, there’s more to spend on public services. That means better roads, better hospitals, better schools, and investment in labor.
When the Government can pay for expansion, that expansion brings more jobs, and more families are lifted away from poverty and toward prosperity. Not every voter will forgive Mutharika for his current perceived transgressions just because they’re earning more money than they used to, and life has become more comfortable, but a comfortable electorate is a lot more likely to stick with the status quo than an angry one.
The connection between an expanding cannabis industry and work becoming available to Malawians is an obvious one. More than eighty percent of the workers in Malawi are employed by the agriculture industry. At the moment, the overwhelming majority of those people work in tobacco. Those tobacco jobs will still be required, and so more people will have to be employed in order to harvest cannabis and prepare it for sale.
In a country that’s still identified by the World Bank as one of the poorest on the planet, that can only be a good thing. There is still more work to be done to ensure that employees are paid a fair wage and aren’t exploited by their employers, but having some income is better than having no income at all, and that’s likely to be the line that the Government uses to sell these new employment opportunities to the public.
None of this will be music to the ears of Lazarus Chakwera, who has never been convinced about the legitimacy of the most recent election and would like to see a new one happen as soon as possible – perhaps even as early as May this year.
Should that happen, it wouldn’t be against the odds for him to improve on his 38% share of the vote last time around. He might even dare to dream of going beyond that and securing 50%, thus fulfilling one of the proposed requirements for electing any new President in the future regardless.
It’s unlikely that the President had any of this in his mind when he first signed the papers that legalized the sale of Malawian cannabis. At that time, he was probably only thinking of increasing the country’s revenue and creating more jobs within his country.
He probably didn’t imagine that it was the masterstroke that would keep him in power when everything else seemed to be going against him. This is a strange world, though, and we’re living in strange times. Somewhat improbably, a combination of COVID-19 and cannabis sales might turn out to be what keeps Mutharika in his office for the foreseeable future.

Kadzamira (c) says only 35 companies satisfied the requirements.
Board chairperson of CRA, Boniface Kadzamila, announced Friday  afternoon in Lilongwe.
Kadzamira said that a total of 41 companies applied but only 35 companies satisfied the requirements.
He said so far, the authority has issued licenses for cultivation, processing and storage and has not yet issued any license for export.
Cannabis production is bringing hope in the economy that it will complement tobacco, the country’s main source of foreign exchange.
Figures show that over a 10-year period, earnings from tobacco have dropped by about 45 percent.
A recent analysis by Invegrow Limited, one of the firms that conducted research on industrial hemp,found that a kilogramme of industrial hemp could fetch about K32 000 on the market and that there is potential for direct annual benefit to Malawians in excess of K3 billion on 16.5 hectares or K195 million per five hectares.
The analysis further indicated that the crop has ready markets whose global value chain is worth about $9 billion (about K6. 6 trillion), giving local investors a basis to take up cannabis production.
The Licensed Organizations are Medigrow, Malawi Mangoes, Africa Gold Ltd, Ortusol Ltd, SADM, Tilimenawo Cannabis Club, Unity Cooperative, Banana 2017, Hempharmaceuticals, ARET, Cannasun Ltd, SABA Agro Ltd, Sikelela Commodities Ltd, Lesta International, Profix eco-Industries Ltd, Bio Sil Technology Africa Limited, B&M Landscaping & General, Greenway, Med-Can Ltd, Organic Cannabis Farmers Cooperative, AKA, Kuwala Agriculture Ltd, Prime Pharmaceuticals, M’mbwelwa Investment Limited, Pharmanova, Dynamic Traders, Capital Food Ltd, Bio-lab Agencies, Milanzi Holdings, Pollen Farm Limited, Women in Vision, Mg Labs Limited, College of Medicine and Rasmusking Company Limited.

The development attracted the attention of Cabinet ministers, Principal Secretaries (PSs), senior traditional leaders and other senior government officials who came to inspect the progress of the project on Saturday.
Women of vision have now seen the first Canabis grain
USCA Chief Executive Officer Wezi Ngalamira, without disclosing the amount of harvest, said the Women of Vision Growers are now planting second crops.
According to Ngalamira, the second crop is in-door plantation that needs extra lights even during night hours.
In order to make sure that it does not miss its target, Women of Vision Growers has already put in place all needed materials and structures.
Amongst them include security structures, greenhouses, irrigation system, which includes a dam, solar energy panels and batteries, which can provide power to 1, 200 bulbs.
The group has also constructed houses for its workers. The Minister of Agriculture, Lobin Lowe, expressed satisfaction after the inspection.
Lowe said if all cooperatives would follow Women of Vision Growers’ footsteps, the country would benefit a lot from the modern “gold” crop.
The Minister of Gender Patricia Kaliati encouraged women in the country to learn from Women of Vision Cannabis Growers saying the group has put Malawian women on the map.
In his remarks, the Cannabis Regulatory Authority (CRA) Board Chairperson, Boniface Kadzamila, said the first harvest by Women of Vision Growers has proven that the country will meet its target.
Women of Vision Growers, which is a group of 14 women who cultivate the industrial hemp, has a mega farm in Chinsinga Village in Traditional Authority Nyaza in the district.

Ngalamila said her organization is doing everything to make sure that all cannabis cooperatives are familiar with how to cultivate and take care of the Malawian new gold crop.
USCA then donated five greenhouses to the group and named it as a cannabis farm learning center.
Ngalamila further disclosed that her organization is ready to support any cooperative facing any problem in the process.
The group said they have so far recruited security personnel from within the surrounding area apart from engaging some villagers in different activities at their farm.
The Cannabis Regulatory Authority (CRA) chairperson, Boniface Kadzamira, urged all cooperatives to follow the advice on cannabis production.
Kadzamira said Malawi stands to benefit from the certified industrial hemp despite poor rains.

Nankhumwa swill help the Malawian economy to bounce back from the contraction experienced in tobacco export – the main foreign earner
The economic potential of the fast-growing global medicinal and industrial cannabis industry has been the main driver of the law change in Malawi.
Nankhumwa  tabled the Cannabis Regulation Billin Palriament to distinguish the criminalised Indian hemp from medicinal cannabis through regulation of research, cultivation, production, processing, possession, storage, export, sale, distribution, use and its products for medicinal, industrial or scientific purposes under prescribed conditions.
  “For a long time, Malawi has relied on tobacco as the main source of foreign exchange, contributing over 60 percent to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). But demand for tobacco has drastically dwindled over the years due to international anti-smoking lobby, bringing about an urgent need to diversify to other cash crops.
  “We believe cannabis can be an effective substitute to tobacco, in the long term,” said Nankhuma in an interview.
  With the new law,  there will be an  establishment of the Cannabis Regulatory Authority (CRA) to be responsible for licensing and regulating medicinal and industrial hemp programmes.
  Nankhumwa said the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development through the Agricultural Extension Services department would embark on a civic education campaign to sensitise the masses to the difference between the allowed industrial hemp and the illegal Indian hemp commonly known among Malawians.
Former deputy minister of agriculture  Joe Manduwa in the president Bakili Muluzi administration (United Democratic Front – UDF)  was the first to table the issue of  legalising  the cultivation, processing and marketing of industrial hemp  for which he was labelled crazy.
It was then picked up later by  Boniface Kadzamira, former Ntchisi North legislator Boniface Kadzamira who tabled the topic in 2015.
Kadazamira also agrres with Nankhumwa that cannabis will  “in the long run replace tobacco to become our major cash crop – that will contribute hugely to the GDP.”
He  explained that the industry will create employment opportunities in the farming and industrial sectors.
Agriculture offers employment to nearly 80% of Malawi’s population. Tobacco is the country’s major export, and the global decline in its use has impacted the economy.
Malawi’s tobacco industry is also marred by exploitation, as international companies such as British American Tobacco have sought cheap labour – including child labour – and
Cannabis, which can thrive in dry conditions, is a good fit for Malawi’s climate, which has been impacted by the southern African drought.

Kadzamir: Local hemp remains illegal to cultivate pic by Tione Andsen (Mana)
Malawi will only grow industrial hemp not Chamba for receation
Board Chairperson for CRA, Boniface Kadzamira revealed that Friday in Lilongwe during a Press Conference at Golden Peacock Hotel on the Issuance of Licences and Permits to Cannabis Growing Organizations.
He said these are the only varieties that have been approved to be grown legally by licensed organizations.
“Growing of local hemp [Chamba] remains illegal by the law and anyone found cultivate will face the arm of the law. Even organizations that have been given licences to grow medicinal and industrial are not allowed to do so,” Kadzamira added.
He said organizations that are growing medicinal hemp have paid a 12 month fee of K 7.5 million with a non refundable application deposit of K850,000 and they would be allowed to renew the licences depending on their performance.
The Chairperson pointed out that organizations venturing into cultivation of industrial hemp have paid a 12 month fee of K1.5 million with a K425, 000.00 a non refundable deposit.
Kadzamira said the expectations are that the licensed organizations would start business now since they are already late.
“Stakeholders, they are free to use irrigation or rain fed in order to produce their products. This would largely depend on their capacities,” he stated.
Kadzamira said currently the country has imported adequate seeds for the two varieties and the expatiation was that the country should start producing its own seed varieties of the hemp.
The Chairperson said CRA has received a funding of K100 million from Ministry of Finance for its operational and they are now ready to do mobilization tours to various communities.
CRA Planning Officer, Kondwani Makoko said although there was outcries that the fees were too high to growers but working in a group of 50 to 100 people have proved to be most effective.
He said cannabis cultivation encourages stakeholders to work as cooperatives and groups in order to minimize the challenges they face in conducting their every daily business.
CAR has awarded 35 organizations with 86 licences to start cultivating Cannabis in the country.

The Cannabis Regulatory Authority (CRA) has entered into a partnership with Canada-based Co2 Evolve to help in cannabis farming in the country.
Co2 Evolve will run the carbon projects that are specifically based around hemp and cannabis plantations.

Speaking on the sidelines of a press briefing in Lilongwe on Monday, CRA Chairperson Boniface Kadzamila said the country is looking for investors like Co2 Evolve for farming to be fruitful.
He said signing of the agreement is a step towards securing a stable market for farmers.
“Cannabis is an incredible plant that offers so much potential for economic development, allowing countries like Malawi to participate in the new emerging green economy.

“This company has brought in new technologies that cannabis can be used for, apart from being medicinal. Anything you can do with wood or petrol chemicals, you can do with hemp and in a green and sustainable way,” Kadzamila said.
Co2 Evolve founder David Curry said cannabis plantations have a baseline revenue source in the form of carbon.
He said carbon projects are now in high demand from the corporate market to offset their emissions, which can be found in cannabis.
“We offer a new revenue stream for our country partners by facilitating corporate investment for carbon and bi-products made from hemp.
“Our plan is to develop new green industries that pioneer sustainable social and economic development here in Malawi and enable Malawi to participate in the new green global economy,” Curry said.
Malawi legalised cannabis farming for medicinal and industrial use in February 2020.

The Ministry of Agriculture is under pressure to consider revisiting its proposed production and license fees for industrial hemp following a leaked draft Cannabis Regulations Act making rounds on social media showing proposed production license fees.
Among other things, the draft Act which is contained in Government Notice number 95, dated November 20 2020, outlines fees aligned to getting license and producing industrial hemp in the country.
For instance, application fees for medicinal and industrial hemp licenses are pegged at $1,000 [about K750, 000] and $500 [about K375, 000], respectively.

License fee to cultivate, process and sell medicinal cannabis is set at $10, 000 [about K7.5 million] while license to process industrial hemp is $5, 000 [about K3.25 million] whereas cultivating and selling industrial hemp is at $2, 000 [bout K1.5 million].
Farmers Union of Malawi Chief Executive Officer Jacob Nyirongo said the rates were exclusive and a deliberate effort to exclude most farmers in Malawi from venturing into production of medicinal cannabis and industrial hemp.
“Surprisingly, the rates for traders of the processed products which are high-value than the raw materials are very low. These rates will disadvantage and exclude most farmers and promote trading,” Nyirongo said.

In a separate interview, agriculture expert Tamani Nkhono Mvula said the charges are too exorbitant for an average Malawian.
“Expectation was that the coming in of industrial hemp would be a way out of dominance of tobacco but also that it will be open to an average Malawian to grow as is the case with tobacco today.
“This crop would have been a sure way out of poverty for most smallholder farmers. However these charges will be a hindrance to most Malawians to participate in the production of this crop. I hope there will be a consideration,” Mvula said.
Some farmers we spoke to randomly said if the government did not reduce the fees, it would simply promote illegal cultivation of the crop.
Ronald Muphuwa said there must be a consideration for the common villager who is interested in cultivating cannabis.
In February this year Parliament passed the Cannabis Regulation Bill which distinguishes industrial hemp from the banned Indian hemp and legalise its production, storage, processing and sell.

A Lilongwe-based company that was set up for processing and exporting of cannabis, Ikaros Africa Limited, has closed shop.
This comes in the absence of an enabling law that allows for production, sales and export of medicinal hemp.
The company’s Managing Director, Chancy Jele, said they could not roll out in the absence of the enabling legislation.

“We invested about $200 million dollars on machines which we bought from Italy. We are now transferring the machines to South Africa. We have been spending K20 million every month as we waited to roll out.
“We have tried to engage ministries of Industry and Trade and Agriculture but nothing seems to be moving. This means the 48 people we employed, all Malawians, have lost their jobs. Without the law we cannot do anything,’’ Jele said.
Parliament passed the Cannabis Regulation Bill in February this year.

The law seeks to distinguish the criminalised Indian hemp (chamba) from medicinal cannabis through cultivation, production, possession and marketing.
Former president Peter Mutharika assented to the bill but it has not yet been gazetted.
Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, Grey Nyandule Phiri, said the ministry is waiting for the operationalisation of the law.
“We are waiting for regulations. There are procedures that we are following. The company could have waited,” Nyandule Phiri said.
The law provides for regulation of research, cultivation, production, processing, possession, storage, export, sales, distribution and use of cannabis and its products for medicinal, industrial or scientific purposes under prescribed conditions.

Lowe made the remarks on Friday during a cooperatives training workshop for cannabis growers in Traditional Authority Nyoka in Mchinji District.
The minister said cannabis production, if taken seriously, has the potential to help the country in achieving the Malawi 2063 development blueprint, which has a pillar of agriculture commercialization.
Minister of Agriculture, Lobin Lowe : Form coops
He said the plant is regulated unlike other crops like maize and beans; hence, the need for those certified farmers to be equipped with expertise so that they meet International standards.
“The trainings are an opportunity to our co-operatives to be well equipped with high standards of skills to meet international standards because unlike other crop they rely on export markets which are highly competitive, hence for our farmers to be competitive, they need to have highly skilled co-operatives,” said Lowe.
However, he warned Malawians with intentions to grow the crop against rushing before getting a license, stressing that doing so would be contravening the law governing the production of cannabis in Malawi.
In her remarks, the United States Cannabis Association Chief Executive Officer, Wezzi Ngalamira, said his organisation will act as bridge between farmers and already identified buyer.
Ngalamira said the association will come up with a system whereby they are going to buy from different farmers and cooperatives on behalf of the US branch.
On prices, she assured the farmers that they will not be duped as it is with other industries “because government will regulate the prices so that there is a win-win situation between the farmer and the buyer.”
The Cannabis Regulatory Authority (CRA) chairperson Boniface Kadzamira expressed optimism that the country stands to benefit from the certified industrial hemp.
Kadzamira warned unlicensed farmers against growing cannabis
Kadzamira said, so far, they have licensed about 72 both local and international companies.
“Let me warn those that haven’t been licensed not to engage themselves into this farming because doing so is contravening the law of the Cannabis Act. The penalties for non-compliance range from 50 million kwacha and 25 years imprisonment, hence people should not dare to taste the law,” he said.
But Kadzamira disclosed that the government is considering issuing some special licenses to local farmers who may wish to grow local varieties so that Malawians can also benefit from their locally produced variety.
Meanwhile, retired renowned international boxer who after retiring from his boxing career is now into cannabis growing in the US Mike Tyson will be the ambassador of the cannabis across the world.

Written by Western Guta
Thursday, 25/11/2021The United States Cannabis Association-USCA has cleared Mike Tyson's profile as somebody who is doing a lot in regards to Cannabis cultivation in the United States of America.
Chief Executive Officer Wezzie Ngalamira told journalists in Lilongwe that proprietors of the company in the USA settled for Tyson because he is doing a lot in regards to Cannabis cultivation.
Ngalamira added, ""Tyson has been USCA partner for quite some time, promoting the crop and innovating the Tyson Ranch variety, one of the varieties that the company is promoting"".
She further said that Tyson is expected to visit Malawi on a date to be announced, and is expected to visit the cancer center and other centers that deal with some chronic illnesses, as they can be cured using medicine manufactured from the Tyson Ranch.
But some quarters have been questioning the rationale behind accepting Tyson as brand ambassador, alledging that he is known for violence and sex offenses.
For example in parliament on Wednesday, Chikwawa North Parliamentarian Owen Chomanika wondered how the youth in the country will be motivated by Tyson.
However, minister of Gender, Children and Social Welfare Patricia Kaliati who was at the time making a statement on 16 days of activism said that the law provides that a sex offender becomes free to mix in the society if they serve jail time for the offense.
""Tyson served his sentence and is a free man. The law provides that everyone is free to mix in the society as long as they complete their jail time"", she said.
Some quarters are not comfortable with the idea that Tyson, a former world heavyweight boxing champion who once was accused of sex offenses in his home country, is Malawi's ambassador of the United States Cannabis Association-USCA.

Canadian cannabis services company, Globe-Cann Inc., has said the local cannabis industry is growing fairly well and has since rated the legislative infrastructure as significant to the growth of the industry, which is in its infancy stage.
This comes after the Cannabis Regulatory Authority (CRA) recently said over 72 companies and cooperatives acquired licences to cultivate and trade in industrial and medicinal hemp.
In an interview on Friday, Globe-Cann Managing Director for South Africa and partner to Globe-Caan. Travis Griffiths hailed the country’s legislative structures.

He rated the legal provision as vital in eradicating illegal markets and bringing about significant benefits in tax revenue, employment and uplifting the economy.
“I believe it is only a matter of time before we see the impact being felt in the area that this industry can bring,” Griffiths said.
He added that both medicinal and industrial sectors of cannabis have value to bring to the country.

Globe-Cann is a Canadian multinational company comprised of Canadian and international cannabis experts, ranging from regulatory experts to licencing, plant construction and design, operations, processing and medicinal sales.
Earlier this year, President Lazarus Chakwera warned that the country’s leading foreign exchange earner, tobacco, was weakening, and urged stakeholders to switch to high-growth crops like cannabis.
Cannabis was certified in Malawi to be cultivated under regulation for use in the industrial and medicinal areas.
As at April 2021, the media reported that an analysis by Invegrow Limited found that a kilogramme of industrial hemp could fetch $1,444 and that there was potential for direct annual benefit for Malawians in excess of $135,440,973 on 16.5 hectares or $8,803,663 per five hectares.

USCA Malawi reportedly advocates for the growth of a responsible and legitimate cannabis industry in the country.
Wezi Ngalamira talking to journalists and a cross section of the young graduate interns
The association’s Chief Executive Officer, Wezi Ngalamira, told journalists on Monday that the four-day training, which began on Sunday at Lake Malawi Anglican University in Lilongwe, has brought together graduates from Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Mwimba Institute of Agriculture and University of Malawi, among other institutions.
Ngalamira said each graduate intern, after being trained on growing of cannabis, will be attached to a USCA farmer cooperative, where there is a fully fledged automated greenhouse, solar panel, borehole and water tank, among other necessary facilities and technologies.
“After we train them, theoretically and practically, we will deploy them to our cooperatives to train farmers for 16 weeks so they are able to handle those facilities and technologies in order to produce the best crop for their own benefit and national development. So we want the interns to be well equipped for the task,” Ngalamira said.
In his remarks, one of the interns, Daniel Mbaya, commended USCA for organizing the training, saying it will equip him, as an agriculturalist, with additional information in the management of the agriculture field, especially the new value chain of cannabis production.

“Being a new crop, there is less information about it. A lot of farmers are not aware of the production requirements. So this training is vital, for the additional information will assist us in making farmers produce the best crop,” Mbaya said.
Cannabis production is bringing hope in the economy of Malawi and there are high expectations that it will complement tobacco, which is the country’s main source of foreign exchange.
A recent analysis by Invegrow Limited, one of the firms that conducted research on industrial hemp, found that a kilogram of industrial hemp could fetch about MK32 000 and that there is potential for direct annual benefit to Malawians in excess of K3 billion on 16.5 hectares or K195 million per five hectares.
The analysis further indicated that the crop has ready markets whose global value chain is worth about $9 billion (about K6. 6 trillion), giving local investors a basis to take up cannabis production.

MDF in partnership to grow cannabis

By Deogratias Mmana
Malawi Defence Force (MDF) has partnered with Greenway Limited to grow, process and export industrial hemp and medicinal cannabis.
MDF will utilise its Liwerezi Farm in Mchinji for the production of the cannabis (chamba).

Cultivation of hemp is one of the reform areas MDF under Ministry of Defence promised to carry out under commercialisation of its agriculture production.
Cannabis Regulatory Authority (CRA) has since granted the venture a licence for the cultivation and exportation of hemp.
“Currently, Malawi Defence Force is holding final negotiations with Greenway Limited, for a partnership agreement to cultivate, process, manufacture, import and export Industrial Hemp and Medicinal Cannabis (IHMS)-related products at Liwerezi MDF Farm in Mchinji,” reads a September 2021 reforms progress report from Ministry of Defence.

The report further says: “A project proposal and business plan for the joint venture are being reviewed by MDF in order to complete an MoU. Meanwhile, licence from Cannabis Regulatory Authority has been obtained for the joint venture.”
MDF acting spokesperson Emmanuel Mlelemba said he was outside the country and needed time to comment on the development.
But CRA Board Chairperson Boniface Kadzamira confirmed the granting of the licence to the enterprise in May this year.
“MDF has entered into an agreement with one of the local investors where MDF has allowed the investor to use one of their farms in Mchinji about the making of uniforms,” Kadzamira said.
He said Greenway Limited was also issued with a licence in the same month this year.
Kadzamira said since CRA was put in place, it has issued about 70 licences to companies and cooperatives including College of Medicine in Blantyre and Agricultural Research and Extension Trust in Lilongwe.
Other companies are Medigrow, Malawi Mangoes, Africa Gold Limited, Tilimenawo Cannabis Club, Capital Food Limited, Pharmanova, Prime Pharmaceuticals, M’mbelwa Investment Limited, Dynamic Traders and Organic Cannabis Farmers Cooperative.
Parliament passed a bill in February 2020 that made it legal to cultivate and process cannabis for medicines and hemp fibre used in industry but stopped short of decriminalising recreational use.
Kadzamira said at that time the authority had received more than 100 applications for licences to venture into the growing of industrial hemp.
He told Reuters in 2020 that hemp – a strain of the cannabis plant that contains little or no tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, the substance that makes people high – has the potential to surpass earnings from tobacco, touted as the country’s main export crop.

Mike Tyson – his appointment faces resistance
CPA acting director Kondwani Bell Munthali, in a statement issued on Wednesday, says he is shocked and dismayed over the purported letter of appointment of Tyson as a brand ambassador for Malawi’s Cannabis.
“The letter allegedly signed by Honourable Lobin Clarke Lowe M.P, Minister of Agriculture, dated 1st of November 2021 and referenced as 30/1/1 is a source of great embarrassment to the Government and the people of Malawi as Mr Tyson is a registered sex offender in the United States of America, where he is expected to represent and promote Malawi cannabis. Mr Mike Tyson was convicted and jailed of raping and serious violence of an 18-year-old woman in 1992. He remains on sex offenders register in Arizona and Florida as per attached evidence,” reads the statement.
Munthali says it is surprising that Malawi would want to have a convicted rapist as its brand ambassador, more especially at the time when efforts to curb violence against women are part of the government agenda.
“As a nation that is working tirelessly to stem out gender-based violence, we cannot be seen to associate or celebrate people of Mike Tyson calibre as a face of promoting any of our products.
“We wish to believe that the letter is fake and such appointment was never considered. Or if it is true, it will be withdrawn with immediate effect.
“The CPA offers due diligence services to business and institutions in Europe, USA, China and Southern Africa to avoid such embarrassments,” warns Munthali.

Cannabis licencees yet to start production

Lazarus Chakwera
The Cannabis Regulatory Authority (CRA) has sad out of the 69 firms which were licenced to cultivate and trade in industrial and medicinal hemp, only four have commenced production.
Cannabis was certified in Malawi to be cultivated for industrial and medicinal use following passing of its law last year.
The regulatory authority has, however, attributed the low number of firms who have moved to, start production to among other things, the need for intense investment.

In an interview last week, CRA Director General Ketulo Salipira said the business requires massive investment and that most businesses and cooperatives were still setting up facilities and processes necessary for production.
He said he was hopeful that the other licence holders would begin production shortly.
“For the cooperatives, especially those that are getting into industrial cannabis production, most of them are waiting for the rainy seasons because they may not afford to put up irrigation structures; so, we believe, as the rainy season begins, we should have a surge in the numbers that are going to begin production,” Salipira said.

He added that, as at now, the authority had received 30 more applications to be considered for licences.
Earlier this year, President Lazarus Chakwera urged stakeholders to switch to high-growth crops like cannabis because the country’s leading foreign exchange earner, tobacco, was weakening.
One of the firms given a licence to venture into cannabis production is Invegrow.
Invegrow Director Nebert Nyirenda said the commodity has the potential to outperform tobacco because the whole plant has different uses that can be exploited.
“Looking at Malawi and the sort of enterprising culture that is here, we should be able to make it. There are many other opportunities within the value chain that are important in order to grow the industry and create jobs,” Nyirenda said.
As at April 2021, the media reported that an analysis by Invegrow found that a kilogramme of industrial hemp could fetch $1,444 and that there was potential for direct annual benefit for Malawians in excess of $135,440,973 on 16.5 hectares or $8,803,663 per five hectares.

Malawi’s parliament passed a bill in February that makes it legal to cultivate and process cannabis for medicines and hemp fibre used in industry, but stops short of decriminalising recreational use
The board chair of Malawi’s regulator, Boniface Kadzamira, said his board had received more than 100 applications for licensing which were under review.
“Our view as regulator is that if we get honest investors, the hemp industry can supplement export revenues from tobacco, and in some cases, surpass it. But it will not immediately replace tobacco,” he added.
Malawians have taken up in various social media platforms to complain that the K7 million (US$10,000) slapped on cannabis growers is very expensive.
Among other things, people and companies will be required to pay $10,000 (equivalent to K7 Million) when acquiring a license to cultivate and sell medicinal hemp.
Apart from that, a fee of $2,000 (Equivalent K1.5 million) is required when obtaining a license to grow and sell industrial hemp.
Dr Ketimo Salipira, acting director general of the Cannabis Regulatory Authority has defended the fees, saying the expectation of the authority is that farmers will operate in cooperatives.
Malawi is famous internationally for its recreational cannabis strain “Malawi Gold”. Cannabis, which can thrive in dry conditions, is a good fit for Malawi’s climate, which has been impacted by the southern African drought.
Salipira, however said the authority will to look into the concerns raised by the public.
Meanwhile, the parliamentary committee on Agriculture has asked government to review fees.
Sameer Suleman, chairperson of the committee described the exorbitant fees as a deliberate move to bar Malawians from benefiting from hemp farming.
Writing on his face book wall, a Malawian who follows closely the production of industrial hemp says the production is both capital and labour intensive.
Wilson Khembo says due to its relation to marijuana, a special permit is required to grow, process, transport and distribute hemp.
“These costs might be slightly lower in Malawi due to cheaper labour costs, however, it is not a cheap crop to produce in general terms,” he says.
“I do understand why the government is trying to put restrictions on hemp production because any lapse in the management and policing of hemp production can lead to serious abuse of the crop,” he says.
He says there is a likelihood that some people may take advantage of  production permit to produce marijuana which remains illegal under Malawi laws.
“I kind of understand the reasoning behind the $10,000 price tag on the production permit because this will stop those with the permit from abusing their licence.
“Putting in place a hemp production control mechanism will cost money and that will be paid for through licensing.
“Maybe the government needs to engage the public a little bit more to justify the $10,000 price tag,” he says.
He says hemp production also requires identifying the market prior to production unlike other crops.
Agriculture offers employment to nearly 80% of Malawi’s population. Tobacco is the country’s major export, and the global decline in its use has impacted the economy. Malawi’s tobacco industry is also marred by exploitation, as international companies such as British American Tobacco have sought cheap labour – including child labour – and low tariffs on raw tobacco for export.

Malawi ready for cannabis output

Gracious Lungu
Malawi is ready to start commercial production and processing of cannabis for medicinal and industrial use, the Cannabis Regulatory Authority has said.
The authority says following passing of a bill last year that makes it legal to cultivate and process cannabis, the country has made strides towards commencement of production of the commodity.
The cannabis is touted as potential replacement for tobacco, Malawi’s single-top export crop, which is facing extinction.

In an interview last week, Cannabis Regulatory Authority Director General Salipira Makoka said there is high potential in developing the cannabis market in Malawi and across the borders.
“If all goes according to plan, Malawi stands to benefit and looking at the value of these products, especially medicinal products on the external market, they will fetch good money.
“We are really optimistic as this could move us a mile from where we are,” Makoka said.

He said plans are in the pipeline to set up a structured market for the commodity.
Introduction of the commodity comes as tobacco is facing myriad challenges including the anti-smoking lobby by the World Health Organisation leading to a drastic drop in both output and revenue in the past decade.
But in an interview, Ministry of Agriculture spokesperson Gracian Lungu said the crop is not dead yet.
“Despite the need to shift from relying too much on tobacco to cannabis, there is still a potential in tobacco and we cannot stop relying on it anytime soon. We will still grow tobacco even up to the last cigarette which will be produced,” Lungu said.
However, President Lazarus Chakwera said recently that country is poised to leave tobacco behind in favour of the prospective high-growth crop, cannabis.
In his State of the Nation Address on Wednesday, Chakwera lamented tobacco’s loss of charm.
“The inconvenient truth is that while Malawi has come a long way by relying on tobacco as our largest single crop contributor to our GDP, this reliance is now seriously threatened by declining demand worldwide,” Chakwera said.

CRA board chairperson Boniface Kadzamira made the call in Lilongwe on Monday during Cannabis Licence-holder’s Engagement meeting for the Central Region growers.
He said growing of medicinal and industrial hemp would be most effective if there are structured markets in place so that growers are able to sell their products.
Kadzamira: Board Chairperson
Kadzamira pointed out that once growers have access to structured markets that lead to steady markets of their products, the industry stands a chance to grow.
“We need to find our own markets within or outside the country. We need to work with the government to develop such markets instead of depending on the promises by investors willing to buy our products. If we will not have structured markets, it will be no work done,” he added.
The CRA board chairperson said universities and research institutes should start working on the local variety to see how effective it could be in the country since it would be in the same family of medicinal hemp.
Kadzamira said local varieties have proven to be marketable and fetch more money in European and overseas markets.
He said the country would have cannabis products in the next six months since the growers are going to plant in the coming rainy season.
“We are growing foreign varieties of cannabis but we need to move and develop our own varieties which should be accessible to all growers. We have huge potential with our own varieties which are marketable,” Kadzamira said.
Acting Director General for CRA, Ketulo Salipira, said before awarding a licence to a cooperative, the latter needs to develop a clear business plan on how they would conduct their business.
He added that the cooperative leadership needs to be cleared by Police to ensure that they have no criminal record regarding dangerous drugs before.
A member of Monkey Bay Cooperative, Beatrice Mwale, said cannabis growing has provided an opportunity for small holders to work in groups.
She said the crop looks promising to the growers and that investors are keen to buy the products for sale on the local and international markets.
“We stand a very good chance of improving our economic status as farmers if we can handle it well to our advantage by using the available openings and opportunities at stake,” Mwale added.

Said MacKintosh: “There is a worldwide phenomenon taking place to legalise cannabis. If we can grow hemp on the higher side the economic benefits will be more than the normal tobacco but let us make sure the industry is regulated.”
He explained that there is a lot of value in using cannabis especially cannabidiol (CBD), a naturally occurring cannabinoid constituent of cannabis, which helps with pain relief, acts as an anti-seizure, combats anxiety and fights cancer.
“In the next three years, it is estimated that the demand for CBD oils will grow by 700 percent. So this is an opportunity Malawi should not miss,” MacKintosh said.
The Indian hemp police uprooted
An advocate for the legalisation of industrial hemp, Ntchisi North legislator Boniface Kadzamira, said it is sad that government has taken long to legalise hemp.
He said: “It is sad that up to now, we haven’t yet changed our laws to allow hemp farming to happen. We would wish for government to legalise it so that people can start investing in it and in return improve the economy.”
It is estimated that one kilogramme of industrial hemp, fetches about K32 000 on the market and that there is potential direct annual benefit to Malawians in excess of K3 billion on 16.5 hectares.
Currently, Zimbabwe, Morrocco and South Africa are among African countries reported to have legalised the growing of industrial hemp.
Parliament gave a go ahead for trials of industrial hemp at Chitedze Research Station and in Salima as studies are still ongoing on whether it can become a viable export product."

Geri Kolin, who is the company’s senior cannabis consultant, told local press that his outfit intends to open a training institution for medicinal cultivation and processing which will target local farmers in the country.
Agri MinistLowe: Companies have up until next week to deliver.
“The company’s vision is to create Africa’s first cannabis hub in Malawi,” Kolin, whose team has also met agriculture minister Lobin Lowe for license processing from the Cannabis Regulatory Authority, said.
In an interview, agriculture ministry spokesman, Grecian Lungu, said the company’s entry into the country was timely.
“[We are] optimistic that local farmers shall benefit from projects to be implemented by the company,” Lungu said.
In April, 2021 officials from the Cannabis Regulatory Authority (CRA) said they had issued 86 licenses to 35 companies and cooperatives to venture into cannabis cultivation for industrial hemp production, board chairperson for the Authority Boniface Kadzamira had said.
Kadzamira said that a total of 41 companies applied but only 35 companies satisfied the requirements.
He said so far, the authority has issued licenses for cultivation, processing and storage and has not yet issued any license for export.
Cannabis production is bringing hope in the economy that it will complement tobacco, the country’s main source of foreign exchange.
Figures show that over a 10-year period, earnings from tobacco have dropped by about 45 percent.
A recent analysis by Invegrow Limited, one of the firms that conducted research on industrial hemp, found that a kilogramme of industrial hemp could fetch about K32 000 on the market and that there is potential for direct annual benefit to Malawians in excess of K3 billion on 16.5 hectares or K195 million per five hectares.
The analysis further indicated that the crop has ready markets whose global value chain is worth about $9 billion (about K6. 6 trillion), giving local investors a basis to take up cannabis production.

Recently, the Cannabis Regulatory Authority (CRA) granted licenses to 35 entities, a development ICA thinks is a great milestone in the history of agriculture in Malawi and presents a new chapter for farmers of the crop and other agro-based industries within the value chain.
“ICA wishes to congratulate organizations that were granted licenses for the cultivation and processing of Legal cannabis. We cannot allow this moment to pass without acknowledging and applauding all individuals and companies that have worked so hard for many years to make this a reality as the journey was long, challenging and at times discouraging,” said ICA executive official Clement Masangano in an interview with Nyasa Times on Monday.
Malawi is making steady progress to replacing tobacco
However, Masangano admitted in an interview with Nyasa Times on Monday that with this accomplishment, expectations from the industry are high due to the hype and emotion that have always accompanied cannabis cultivation in Malawi.
He said the association anticipates that the cultivation of cannabis will translate into both macro and micro multiplier economic gains for the nation as the country expects to create more jobs and income at all levels.
Masangano added that the government stands to benefit from revenue generated at various stages as license fees and taxes.
“Currently, tobacco, which has historically been the country’s primary cash crop, is facing a massive global anti-smoking campaign, which has inevitably affected demand for the crop thus reducing foreign exchange earnings for the country. Cannabis provides hope as a crop that should complement tobacco in the short to long term,” he said.
“From agronomic point of view, there are expectations as well. Cannabis is a wonder crop with a wide range of downstream products and applications. Every part of the plant from flowers, stems, seeds can be a focus for production and various products can be extracted to fit specific needs. This in itself presents a huge opportunity for the country to industrialize and add value to cannabis products. Cannabis is known to be an ideal crop that fits well in rotational systems and can be combined with other crops to strengthen the soil systems and help augment good soil characteristics which have been lost through years of monoculture,” he added.
But Masangano was quick to point out that several aspects need to be considered if Malawi is to safeguard the expected benefits.
He said as a novel crop with a regulatory framework in its infancy, there is a need to strengthen the regulatory capacity and awareness of the regulatory processes as well as government research and extension systems to better enable them to reach out to Malawians at the grassroots, to capacitate and build up smallholder farmers into competent and capable participants in the cannabis value chains.
He also observed that legal cannabis is morphologically similar to the illegal cannabis and this fact can be exploited in a manner that may tarnish the image of an industry that is in its formative stages.
Masangano stressed that such practices need to be strictly monitored and clamped down on to avoid jeopardizing access to the most lucrative markets, which often have very stringent regulatory requirements.
He recommended that for those with interest in cannabis, caution must be taken to ensure that investment decisions are made on the basis of accurate and reliable sources of information.
ICA was established in 2014 to act as a voice and partner for information gathering, research, education and lobbying in the field of legal cannabis.
The association brings together pioneers and industry leaders and has been instrumental in the establishment and advancement of the local cannabis industry.

Nankhumwa: We will civic educate the masses on difference between  legal cannabis  and illegal Indian Hemp
Malawi hemp body chairperson Jere (right)  delighted with the Bill passing
Invegrow Limited, a company that was established in 2013 designed to grow and process Industrial Hemp in the country, plans to start commercial growing of the crop
Malawi will only grow industrial hemp not Chamba for receation
Nankhumwa, who tabled the Cannabis Regulation Bill, legalising the growing of cannabis, a crop that could supplement the tobacco industry, which has been the country’s economic mainstay, said the legislation was long overdue.
Lawmakers unanimously passed the new law legalising the farming, importing and exporting of cannabis for medicinal and industrial use.
The legislation will also see the establishment of the Cannabis Regulatory Authority (CRA) to be responsible for licensing and regulating medicinal and industrial hemp programmes.
The CRA will be tasked with issuing licences to cultivate process, store, sell, export and distribute cannabis.
Nankhumwa said the process will be “implemented swiftly.”
Commentators and stakeholders have said making right moves in terms of implementation of the cannabis project will make the country thrive and prow the economy.
Chauncy Jere, a director of Ikaros Africa, one of the two companies conducting industrial hemp trials in Central Malawi, expressed delight with the passing of the Bill.
“We are very happy that finally we’re taking the right steps to move the country’s economy forwards,” Jere said.
“There’s no denying that cannabis would be a lucrative industry and its demand is huge,” said Jere, who is spokesman for the Hemp Association of Malawi.
Financial crimes expert Jai Banda lauded parliament’s decision as government has for years lost out on valuable tax revenue.
“Cannabis is mainly cultivated in remote areas, mainly for export to surrounding countries such as South Africa, Kenya and the overseas market. Trade is organised by professional traffickers,” Banda said.
“It has been a long journey but here we are. I guess we will be able to export and thereby earn the much needed forex. This is a path in the right direction.”
Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world and has long relied on tobacco which brings in around 60 percent of foreign exchange earnings.
Several countries have decriminalised the growing and use of medicinal cannabis.
Cannabis has for many years been illegally grown in remote parts of Malawi and smuggled out of the country.
The grade is popularly known as “Malawi gold”.

0Invegrow Malawi Limited, a firm that grows and processes industrial hemp, has asked the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security to speed up the implementation of the Cannabis Regulation Act.
This, the firm says, will enable the country to start reaping benefits from the crop.
Chancellor College students admire some of the products made from industrial hemp
Invegrow Limited director Nerbert Nyirenda, whose firm conducted research which showed that the crop can perform well in Malawi, blamed bureaucracy for hindering the implementation of the legislation.
He said: “The Act has to be gazetted and the responsible minister has to gazette both the effective date of the Act and regulations to operationalise the Act.”
In February this year, Parliament passed the law which was assented to by President Peter Mutharika to regulate research, cultivation, production, processing, possession, storage, exportation, sale, distribution and use of cannabis and its products for medicinal, industrial or scientific purposes under prescribed conditions.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security is yet to gazette the law and come up with regulations to ensure that the law is operational.
The ministry’s spokesperson Priscilla Mateyu said in an interview on Monday that they are currently developing guidelines and regulations to facilitate the implementation of the law.
She said: “Government is working towards implementation of the cannabis law and it is taking into consideration all aspects of that law.
“Interested individuals must be patient. Once all processes are finalised, government will inform interested parties.”
Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture and Food Security chairperson, Ulemu Chilapondwa, in an interview on Monday said the committee has been receiving numerous complaints from stakeholders in line with the ministry’s delay in coming up with regulations to operationalise the law.
“The law is the landmark legislation for Malawi because it introduces medicinal cannabis which is a sensitive crop and can be misconstrued by people with the illegal Indian hemp,” he said.
The law establishes the Cannabis Regulatory Authority, which will be responsible for licensing and regulating medicinal and industrial hemp programmes."

0Parliament has passed the Cannabis Regulation Bill which seeks to distinguish the criminalised Indian hemp (chamba) from medicinal cannabis through cultivation, production, possession and marketing. 
 The Bill provides for regulation of research, cultivation, production, processing, possession, storage, export, sales, distribution and use of cannabis and its products for medicinal, industrial or scientific purposes under prescribed conditions. 
 Further, the Bill provides that all citizens seeking to grow cannabis should obtain a license from a regulator.

0Parliament on Thursday passed the Cannabis Regulation Bill to facilitate the growing of medicinal cannabis, a crop most members of Parliament (MPs) described as critical to economic diversification and an alternative cash crop to tobacco.
The Bill, tabled by Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development Kondwani Nankhumwa, seeks to distinguish the criminalised Indian hemp from medicinal cannabis through regulation of research, cultivation, production, processing, possession, storage, export, sale, distribution, use and its products for medicinal, industrial or scientific purposes under prescribed conditions.

The Bill also proposes establishment of the Cannabis Regulatory Authority (CRA) to be responsible for licensing and regulating medicinal and industrial hemp programmes.
In an interview after the Bill was passed, Nankhumwa said the Bill was long overdue. He said the processes will now be implemented swiftly.
The minister said the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development through the Agricultural Extension Services department would embark on a civic education campaign to sensitise the masses to the difference between the allowed industrial hemp and the illegal Indian hemp commonly known among Malawians.
Malawi Congress Party (MCP) spokesperson on agriculture issues in Parliament Richard Chimwendo Banda urged government to put mechanisms that will ensure that ordinary Malawians benefit more from the crop than big estates and foreigners.
He also asked for balance in the CRA composition after noting that there are seven government officials against four members from professional bodies.
United Democratic Front spokesperson on agriculture in Parliament Lillian Patel said government should ensure that the law starts operating in the coming growing season.
Mangochi South West legislator Shadreck Namalomba (Democratic Progressive Party) said tobacco has failed the nation; hence, asked the government to regulate cannabis pricing to incentivise farmers and local investors.
Kasungu Central legislator Ken Kandodo (MCP) spoke against the K50 million fine and 25 years maximum prison sentence for contravening the provisions of the Bill, saying it was harsh considering that most growers will be smallholder farmers.
In his statement winding up debate on the Bill, Nankhumwa said some of the concerns MPs raised will be addressed by the regulations to be crafted to create a conducive environment for operationalising the law.
In 2018, former Ntchisi North legislator Boniface Kadzamira (Independent) moved Parliament through Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs to draft a Bill to distinguish the criminalised Indian hemp from medicinal cannabis through cultivation, production and possession.
Yesterday, several MP paid tribute to Kadzamira for introducing the cannabis issue in the National Assembly for which he was labelled crazy but it was for national good. "

“We have been discussing with clients and investors that we will be working with. Some are from Europe, Australia and Israel. We want people to be accessing advanced medical help right here in Malawi,” she explained.
President of Society of Medical Doctors in Malawi, Dr Victor Mithi, has said the project will ease problems that the country faces when importing medical drugs.
“Cannabis has so many components that help in manufacturing drugs. This project is feasible and it will help the country to ensure availability of essential drugs,” he said.

Written by Happy Njalam'mano
Friday, 04/02/2022About five investors rolled out the farming out of over 100 licensed
- internet pic
The Cannabis Regulatory Authority (CRA) says cannabis farming is facing technical and financial challenges in its maiden year.
Director General for the Authority, Dr. Ketulo Salipira, says farmers are banking on foreign investors for technical information.
“Most of them are financial and others are capacity challenges but many are linking up with financial institutions and others are working with investors to help them with financial support for their businesses.
“Technically, investors especially those from outside the country have the know-how so we are banking on them to help with technical information when it comes to ground work,” he said.
Dr. Salipira, however, says expectations are high that more farmers will roll out the farming this year.
“After licensing them, many started putting up structures on the ground and sourcing funds. But we are optimistic that many of them are going to start this year.
“We have promises, others are coming to see where they are going to do the production,” he said.
Economic expert, Milward Tobias, says investors should look beyond financial institutions for support.
Technically, Tobias says the challenges “are genuine because this is the first year for the country to start growing cannabis. Farmers should learn from others outside the country or they can go online and learn.”
About five investors rolled out the farming out of over 100 licensed.
The crop estimates will be determined at least by mid this year, according to Dr. Salipira.

High returns value expected in Cannabis production can be greatly affected if proper seed is not used in production of the crop, an expert have warned.
Muiltinational Cannabis Ikaros Africa official Chauncy Mopho Jere in an exclusive interview with Nyasa Times says the Smart CBD Seeds Choice for growing Medical Cannabis in Malawi is so important for improved returns.
Chamba: ‘Malawi’s Green Gold.’
However, Jere said there is no need to panic as there is a solution on the same.
“If you are growing medical cannabis in Malawi, buying high-CBD seeds from Ikaros Africa is the smart and easy choice.
“In fact, if you want to legally grow a high-value medicinal cannabis product, it’s the only choice.”
Jere has cited three choices on why it is important to buy good seeds.
He said buying the wrong seeds will directly affect the quality and value of the end product and, as consequence, the value of entire business.
“Cannabis sativa or “hemp” plants contain hundreds of medicinal compounds, mostly cannabinoids and terpenes. The two most common and beneficial ones are THC and CBD.
“Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) offers great value for treating certain medical conditions like pain and chemotherapy side-effects.”
Jere added: “THC is most famous for its psychoactive effect. In other words, THC gets you “high” – like local “chamba” does,” he said.
Jere said CBD is non-psychoactive, meaning it doesn’t cause a person to get “high”.
“In fact, in the right ratio, it can limit or even prevent the psychoactivity caused by THC. CBD also has outstanding medical potential, more than any other cannabis compound. It has even been called the miracle molecule.”
He said CBD seed or cannabidiol, to give it its scientific name, is world-famous for being a natural alternative to many conventional drugs and that it has shown potential to combat conditions like epilepsy, inflammation, anxiety, cancer, pain, depression, arthritis, diabetes, viruses and the list goes on.
Jere said: “High-CBD seed brings High Profitability. For cannabis growers, here’s the secret: not all hemp seeds are equal. In Malawian law, hemp plants must have less than 1% THC, but the CBD limit is not specified.
“Low-CBD plants, commonly referred to as “industrial hemp,” are usually grown for purposes like making textiles, protein powders and animal feed.”
If your goal is to make effective medicine, you must buy high-CBD and not low-CBD seeds. Ikaros Africa sells high-CBD seeds from award-winning, international breeders.”
Jere has since encouraged Cannabis farmers to go for Quality seeds since its the only secret for quality and improved production.
Cannabis, generally is prohibited for recreational use, but remains a popular drug and is produced for domestic use in Malawi and international export.
Malawi, through Cannabis Regulatory Authority recently announced that it is now ready to start commercial production and processing of cannabis for medicinal and industrial use.
Malawi’s parliament passed a bill in February that makes it legal to cultivate and process cannabis for medicines and hemp fibre used in industry, but stops short of decriminalising recreational use.
A growing number of countries around the world are either legalising or relaxing laws on cannabis as attitudes towards the drug change.
They include several in southern Africa, including Zambia, Lesotho and Zimbabwe.

Malawi looks to industrial hemp crop to increase foreign earnings
Speaking to the Malawi UK Business Group reception in London, Director of Investment Promotion Joshua Nthankomwa said Malawi is set to have Industrial Hemp and Medicinal Cannabis programmes rolled out at different levels.
“The Special Crops Act is already in place, what we need now are regulations to govern the growing with Industrial Hemp licensing to start as soon as Government gives necessary approvals to regulations. There will be controls on who and how can one grow Industrial Hemp, basically through green houses,” said Nthakomwa, who presented the two as existing investment opportunities in Malawi.
Nthakomwa said for the two sectors, controls will extend to include local processing of the plants as no raw hemp or cannabis will be exported to ensure that Malawi gains maximum benefits from the growing of the crop.
“We have registered huge interests from companies in Canada, Israel and many other places. We look forward to many more investors coming, not only in this sector, but many other sectors that Government has created environment for one to grow their business,” he said.
InveGrow, a private company has been conducting trials on Industrial Hemp at Chitedze Research Station and the results were submitted pending further approval and proper framework for licenses to be issued.
Internet search indicates an acre with 25000 plants can fetch up to US$60,000 in the USA in states where hemp has been legalised, indicating massive potential for a high yield crop that would surpass most of current commercial crops and minerals

Lobin Lowe
The government has appointed former World Boxing Heavyweight champion Mike Tyson as brand ambassador for local Industrial and Chemical Hemp, collectively known as Cannabis.
In a letter dated November 1 2021, Minister of Agriculture Lobin Clarke Lowe notifies Tyson of the appointment, saying it was in line with legislation which the government passed to legalise cannabis.
“This created opportunities for the legal cultivation of cannabis for both medicinal and industrial purposes and offering the country an opportunity to diversify the country’s agricultural production and potentially generating the much-needed foreign exchange,” the letter reads.

The letter also explains that Malawi needs partners to succeed in the project.
“In spite of all these perceived benefits, Malawi may not go it alone as the industry is complex requiring collaboration. I would therefore like to appoint you, Mr Mike Tyson, as Malawi’s Cannabis Branch Ambassador,” the letter reads.
Ministry of Agriculture publicist Gracious Lungu confirmed the development, saying Tyson was expected to visit Malawi last week.

“It is true that the government is facilitating the appointment of Mr. Tyson [Mike] as an ambassador for industrial hemp in the country due to his role in promoting products which are made from cannabis elsewhere. He will visit the country any time soon,” Lungu said.
He said Tyson would visit the country under the United State Cannabis Association, an off taker company which was engaged by the Malawi Government to help local farmers who are interested in cannabis farming with expertise before acquiring licences.
Lungu said, according to cannabis regulations of 2020, export of raw hemp is prohibited such that Tyson will help in promoting products which will be produced from industrial hemp locally.
“The idea by government is to have industries which will be processing products locally. So, for those products to be known abroad, we need to have a strong brand to help promote them. Among otherthings, we are expecting to have some cancers medicine produced locally once all arrangements are made,” he said.
According to marca.com, after retiring from boxing, Tyson has dedicated time to his own businesses, one of which has to do with cannabis plantation.
“His company is called ‘Tyson Ranch’ and is located in the US state of California, where marijuana use has been legalised since 2016.
“According to the publication Cheat Sheet, Tyson earns a staggering 500,000 dollars a month from the aforementioned business, although he has acknowledged on numerous occasions that he spends about 40,000 dollars on marijuana for himself and his guests,” the article reads.
Tyson became the youngest heavyweight boxing champion of the world in 1986, at age 20 and retired in 2005 with a record of 50 wins including 44 knockouts and six defeats.

Hemp the woman hid in the baskets
Police Prosecutor Sergeant Getrude Chingolo Kafumbula told the court that the suspect Veronica Mwala was on 1st December last year at Chingeni road block found with two baskets containing Indian hemp weighing 62.5 kilograms which is contrary to regulation 19(1) as read with 4(a) of Dangerous Drug Act.
“The suspect was traveling in a motor vehicle registration number BP 1870 from Nkhotakota heading Blantyre, and upon being searched at Chingeni road block, it was discovered that the baskets that had dried fish on top contained Indian hemp,” Kafumbula told the court.
The suspect pleaded guilty to the offence and upon submission of the facts by the state, the court found her with the case to answer and consequently convicted her.
In her submission before sentence Kafumbula asked the court to consider giving the suspect a stiffer sentence saying that people like Veronica are the ones who are contributing to the bad behavior of the youths.
“Giving such people a stiffer sentence can be one way of protecting our children” Kafumbula said.
In her mitigation, the suspect Veronica Mwala asked for forgiveness saying she was doing this because of poverty and that she has five children to look after. She said the father of the children divorced her and she is the only parent who looks after them.
Passing judgment, Second Grade Magistrate Victor Sibu conquered with the state that people like Veronica are contributing to the bad behavior of the youths.
He said a lot of children are behaving strangely these days because of dangerous drugs like Indian hemp.
The Magistrate  therefore said the suspect deserved a stiffer sentence and then ordered her to pay a fine of K60, 000.00 and in default serve a 2 months custodial sentence.

CRA director general, Ketulo Salipira, said the numbers were few because a majority of those that have been licensed are hoping to depend on rain-fed while others are still setting up their irrigation facilities.
Dr. Ketulo Salipira, Director General, CRA
According to CRA, the four companies currently growing the crop are Mchinji Cannabis Cooperatives, Invegrow Limited, CPG Investments and Women of Vision.
“The licenses have one year lifespan subject to renewal and we expect that within the period, the licensees will have produced the crop as planned.
“The industry is a complicated one and new in this country, we are just setting it up. However, we expect those who have already started producing like Invegrow, they will start exporting between January and February next year when the economy will start benefiting from the industry,” Salipira said.
CRA licensed 48 firms for medicinal cannabis and 35 firms for industrial hemp production while six were licensed for research purposes on the crop varieties.
Farmers Union of Malawi (FUM) chief executive officer, Jacob Nyirongo, said cannabis has emerged as an alternative crop to tobacco, but said there is need for government commitment to ensure that the value chain takes an inclusive process.
“It’s a new crop and there are challenges. The conditions that farmers are supposed to meet in order to grow the crop are quite difficult to meet.
“It requires public investment in terms of extension services, training, advisory services and financing, without this, we will see farmers being excluded,” Nyirongo is quoted as saying in the press.
License fees to cultivate and sell as well as the license to process is pegged at $10 000 (about K7.4 million) for medicinal cannabis and license fees to cultivate and sell industrial hemp is at $2 000 (about K1.4 million).
On the other hand, a license to process industrial hemp is pegged at $5 000 (about K3.7 million).
Other requirements include that farmers should present a business plan to the CRA and should have readily identified markets upon application for production.
Invegrow director, Nebert Nyirenda, said the they have started hemp cultivation under greenhouses to produce flowers for extracts or premium grade flowers for export.
He said their greenhouses occupy nearly 10 000 square meter of space and the factory space of nearly 1 200 square meters which is already completed and connected to 3 phase power and that processing equipment is being procured.
An economic expert, Milward Tobias, has since tipped licensed companies and cooperatives to swiftly work on developing irrigation facilities as cannabis has potential to boost country’s revenue base.

Written by Happy Njalam'mano
Monday, 23/03/2020Malawi parliamentary passed a legislation legalizing industrial hemp farming
- file photo
One of foreign investors interested in industrial hemp production in the country says the COVID-19 outbreak has affected progress of their plans to invest in the country.
A research fellow at the Center for Bio-cultural Diversity at the University of Kent in the United Kingdom, Dr. Axel klein, says the spread of the virus has put everything on hold.
“We have to look at circumstances at the moment. With the spread of the virus, everything is put on hold. That is something that we need to be aware of. Everything is suspended for the moment,” he said.
Dr. Klein told Zodiak Online from the UK which is in a lockdown that they are expecting to make progress once the virus is contained after Malawi Parliament passed a bill to legalize the crop.
“The Malawi Parliament by passing the legislation has really changed the whole context and we will move forward once things return to normal,” he said.
Dr. Klein says they are looking on the cultivation of hemp “as a new crop which is an alternative to charcoal and firewood.
“We had a number of actors in the field who were exploring hemp for medicine and fiber.
“We are now working on finding suitable strength for Malawi climatic conditions. We are working with a university in Jamaica to identify strength.”
According to energypedia.info, charcoal in Malawi is mostly unsustainably produced from live trees: “over 60% of the charcoal is made from wood originating from protected Forest Reserves and National Parks; even firewood is unsustainably collected.”
Malawi Parliament in February this year passed a legislation legalizing industrial hemp after years of heated debate on whether to or not to give the crop a nod.

‘MPs key to chamba use in Malawi’
Tom Sangala
September 20, 2018
494 1 minute readAdvertisement
By Taonga Sabola:
The government has said lawmakers hold the key to whether Malawi could legalise the cultivation and use of cannabis sativa, locally known as chamba.
Information Minister, Nicholas Dausi, was reacting to the decision by South Africa’s highest court to legalise the private use of cannabis on Tuesday, a development commentators believe would open doors of opportunity for Malawi in the wake of continued suppressed earnings from top forex earner, tobacco.

Dausi said, unless the laws of Malawi are changed, cannabis remains an illegal substance in Malawi.
In his judgement in South Africa on Tuesday, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said: “It will not be a criminal offence for an adult person to use or be in possession of cannabis in private for his or her personal consumption.”
But Dausi said Malawi has its own laws which have to be respected.

“So far, the law regarding the use of cannabis has not been changed. Unless Parliament meets to change the law, cannabis remains illegal in Malawi,” Dausi said.
Calls for Malawi to legalise cannabis were brought to Parliament in April 2000 when the then deputy minister of Agriculture, Joe Manduwa, asked the House to allow the cultivation and use of the banned substance.
Indian hemp is illegal and those found cultivating, in possession or trading the same are arrested and prosecuted in courts of law.
Manduwa told the House Malawi stood to benefit a great deal from cultivating the plant which, according to him, is a much-sought-after commodity on the world market as it has important uses that can earn this country a lot of foreign exchange, as it happens in countries that have legalised the use of the product.
Around 2015, Malawi approved the use cultivation of industrial hemp on trial basis.

The commercial growing of the hemp crop
The prospective cannabis farmers claim they have invested K30 million in the industrial hemp farming.
M’mbelwa Investment Limited spokesperson Rev. William Mumba said Saturday n Mzuzu that delays to issue licenses are frustrating.
He said the government should issue them with the licences.
“We are extremely concerned as famers because we have invested a lot into this venture. We had all the trust in our government that they would fulfill what was promised because it is about the country’s economy and the economy of individuals. The minimum investment by a single individual is about K700,000.00 while the maximum is 30 million Kwacha.
“It’s very unfortunate that government does not seem to be concerned and this is where we think we might consider mobilizing ourselves to force government to refund the money. If government issued the licences, farmers from Mzimba alone would bring into the country approximately $2 billion. This would certainly help to boost the economy of the country,” explained Mumba.
Another concerned farmer, Martin Kumwenda, wondered why an initiative conceived by government itself was also being hindered by the same government.
“We were asked by the same government to get organized to grow cannabis. We underwent trainings, paid licence fees and got down to prepare land. We are very concerned that government does not bother the time frame that was agreed upon,” lamented Kumwenda.
Last Thursday, agriculture authorities updated farmers that they were waiting for Ministry of Justice to gazzette names of board members by this week.

51,51,https://www.nyasatimes.com/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-cbd-oil-derived-from-cannabis-now-legal-in-south-africa/,www.nyasatimes.com,Cannabis,"5 things you need to know about CBD oil derived from cannabis now legal in South AfricaJanuary 28, 2020 Nyasa Times Reporter Be the first to commentCannabidiol  an active agent found in plants of the cannabis variety, such as hemp and marijuana (CBD oil) has been riding a wave of popularity for the last few years as a result of relaxed laws, word of mouth product reviews, and even celebrity endorsement. When derived from the hemp plant CBD oil contains no THC (less than 0.3%) so it can offer wellness benefits without making you feel high. The market for CBD is so explosive right now that it grew from $358 million to $813 million in just one year.
South Africa has just officially changed its legal rules on cannabidiol or CBD – a compound derived from cannabis which is known for having medicinal properties, such as treating muscle pain and helping to manage cancer patients’ symptoms 
Part of the appeal is the many health and wellness claims being made by daily users of CBD. Claims are being made that CBD oil helps relieve symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, arthritis, chronic illnesses, cancer treatments, and a whole lot more. With the potential to touch so many lives, it’s easy to see why this product is so hot right now. To date, there has not been an abundance of published studies that confirm these claims but as laws soften we will be able to gather more and more empirical data. Early studies are extremely positive although some scientists remain skeptical.
According to CBD KYRO, now is the time to jump in and become an investor as global demand is driving the profit margin sky high. Countries all over the world are developing CBD-friendly laws and the demand is hard to meet so importing will play a crucial role. One place that is particularly true for right now is South Africa. Here are 5 things you need to know about CBD oil legalization in South Africa.
5 things you need to know about CBD oil legalization in South Africa
#1. South Africa is the first country of the African continent to legalize non-prescription CBD sales and use. Amendments to the Medicines and Related Substances Act of 1965 removed CBD preparations for nonserious health claims from a restricted list. The rule includes any product with a CBD maximum daily dose of 20 milligrams. These products are allowed to have an “accepted low risk” health claim as long as they don’t mention specific illnesses or claim to be a cure for any condition. The “accepted low risk” status is seen by many as a stamp of approval from the government that CBD oil is a safe and effective product, although they come just short of actually endorsing the product. Consumers have confidence though and that drives demand.
#2. In South Africa, you can use cannabis products, including those with THC, if you have a prescription. The medical cannabis laws have been in place since 2017. They ruled that the possession and use of dagga, the South African term for marijuana, is legal. You can only get dagga by prescription but you don’t need a specific medical marijuana card like in other countries. Individuals can grow and cultivate for personal use but commercial enterprises need licenses from the local government.
#3. Not very many cultivation licenses have been given out and there are no in-country manufacturers at this time. Only 21 cultivation licenses have been applied for to-date and there are zero licensed manufacturers of CBD products locally. The laws are new and not yet set in stone so local businesses are being cautious. This means the products that are in high demand are currently being imported into South Africa from other countries.
#4. There is a huge market potential for CBD oil sales in South Africa and right now 100% of the products are being imported from other countries. CBD is a major buzzword in the health and wellness sectors with 6.4 million Google searched related to the products each month. This industry is heading towards the billion-dollar mark and is expected to be a 10 billion dollar industry by 2024. South African companies see this as a great investment opportunity.
#5. Clicks and Dis-Chem became the first South African pharmacies to carry over-the-counter CBD oil products. Popular pharmacy retailers in South Africa are already stocking their shelves with CBD products by importing them from outside the region. CBD products started appearing on pharmacy shelves recently in Johannesburg and Cape Town. They are being shelved in the homeopathic goods aisles.
Vaping Is On The Rise For CBD Users
There are plenty of ways to ingest CBD oil such as drops, gummies, supplements, or vaping. While smoking might be out of fashion, vaping is back on the rise. CBD vape juice is made from a mixture of CBD oil and a carrier liquid that is used with a vaporizer. The vaporizer heats up the mixture creating a vape you can inhale. The vape juice can come in different flavors.
Daily CBD Mag outlines how to choose the best CBD vape devices. For beginners, you can start with a simple pre-filled disposable vape pen. An easy and cheap option, the disposable vape pen is great for people that just want to dip their toe in the water and see what CBD is all about. When you’re reading to become a regular user you can get rechargeable and refillable reusable vape devices.
Vaping CBD oil will not get you high, as most legal CBD oils contain little to no THC (The psychoactive ingredient that produces the high feeling). Because of this, CBD is safe to use throughout the day. Many people use CBD oil for pain relief, inflammation, anxiety, and other medical conditions.
Where To Buy CBD Oil In South Africa 
While you are starting to see a few CBD oils pop up on store shelves in major cities around South Africa, your best bet for a wide selection is to shop online. If you aren’t sure where to start, check out this list of the best CBD oils money can buy, from Cool Things Chicago. With a lack of tight regulation, there are some fake products out there and you don’t want to get duped. Always buy CBD products from highly trusted companies by doing your homework before ordering.

Zimbabwe to legalise industrial hemp
Tom Sangala
August 8, 2019
2,815 Less than a minuteAdvertisement
Zimbabwe will change its laws to allow farmers to grow industrial hemp for export, cabinet ministers said on Tuesday, adding that the government saw the plant as a future substitute for tobacco, the country’s biggest export earning crop.
Industrial hemp is a strain of a cannabis species that is grown specifically for industrial uses of its derived products. Its fiber is used in textiles and paper and also produces edible seeds.
The southern African nation’s laws only allow cultivation of cannabis for medical and scientific uses.

Authorities said last year in April that Zimbabweans could apply for licences to grow cannabis for medical and research purposes, but the process has been slow as authorities try to put in place laws to ensure cannabis farms are secure.
“But with hemp, it’s not toxic as cannabis,” acting industry and commerce minister July Moyo told a post-cabinet media conference.
“The minister of justice has been directed to say ‘go and make amendments’ to the criminal code in our system so that people who will grow hemp don’t have to be criminalised.”

Crap weed: Malawian took Cannabis to Irish police station to complain that it was “not of good quality”
Liwembe, with an address at an asylum-seekers’ reception centre,  was immediately arrested.
When the matter was taken to court, the Malawian pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of cannabis and other charges.
According to the Irish Independent, Judge John Hughes said Liwembe’s behaviour was “illogical to say the least” and was indicative of a cannabis-induced psychosis.
He adjourned the case for a probation report.
Police told the court that Liwembe went to Kilmainham Garda Station last July 10 and produced a bag of cannabis valued at €10 from his pocket.
He was searched and a box-cutter knife was found on him. The blade was for use in his work as a handyman, said defence solicitor Anne Fitzgibbon.
Liwembe, according to the reports, came  h from Malawi in 2012 as a student nurse but his visa ran out and he applied for residency on the basis of having an Irish-born child.
Liwembe had been using cannabis, which could lead to “transient psychotic symptoms”, the lawyer added.
He was now off the drug.
Judge Hughes remanded him on continuing bail.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Act (Cap 35: 02) of the Laws of Malawi, there are three schedules of controlled substances known as Parts which weigh a drug’s medical value and its abuse potential.
Rastafarian man smoking cannabis
A controlled substance is therefore placed in its schedule (Part) based on its medical value and potential for abuse. In Malawi, a medical value is typically evaluated based on scientific research particularly large-scale clinical trials conducted in western countries.
Abuse is considered to be a case whereby individuals consume a substance on their own initiative (without prescription from a licensed medical practitioner), leading to personal health hazards or dangers to society as a whole.
Under this scheduling system as stipulated in the Dangerous Drugs Act, Part 1 and 2 drugs are considered to have literally no medical value and high potential for abuse. Part 3 drugs are recognized to have some potential for abuse but enormous medical value. Hence the general public is allowed to access and consume Part 3 drugs only with a prescription issued by a licensed medical practitioner.
It may be helpful to think of the scheduling system as made up of two distinct groups: nonmedical and medical. The nonmedical group is the Part 1 and 2 drugs, which are considered to have no medical value but aren’t numerically ranked based on abuse potential. The medical group is the Part 3 drugs which are recognized to have some medical value.
Cannabis and raw opium are Part 1 drugs while prepared opium is in Part 2. So the Malawi Government considers cannabis and opium (raw and prepared) to have a potential for abuse and no medical value. Hencethesedrugsmustalways bekeptawayfromthereachofthegeneralpublicandevenmedical practitioners/researchersonthegroundsthatthesedrugsareexceedinglydangerous June 2015.
Whereasmedicinal opium, medicinal cocaine and medicinal morphine are Part 3 drugs.
In contrast, alcohol and tobacco are exclusively exempted from this scheduling system.
Alcohol and tobacco are the deadliest drugs not cannabis
Alcohol is currently the second deadliest drug in USA. It is topped only by another legal substance called ‘tobacco’ which in USA alone causes anastonishing500,000 deaths each year
No other drugcomes close to the staggering fatalities of alcohol and tobacco. Heroin, which has consumed widespread media attention in the past few years, was linked to fewer than 9,000 death in 2013 in USA.
Marijuana, another drug that Malawi Government including some health practitioners have persistently warned that it is alarmingly dangerous to individuals and society has caused zero overdose death globally in the past thousand years!
Other countries, like the UK, USA and Australia, use similar scheduling systems, although their specific rankings for some drugs differ.
Anomaly with Malawi Government’s scheduling system
Unlike Industrial hemp (one variety of cannabis), besides containing tetrahydro cannabinol (THC) a psycho effect compound which makes people high when they smoke, marijuana as another variety of cannabis (distinct from industrial hemp) also contains a compound called cannabidiol (CBD). CBD possesses amazing and enormous therapeutic properties. Unlike THC, CBD is also medically proven to be non-psychoactive.
Just because it is associated with cannabis (particularly the marijuana variety), as far as the Dangerous Drugs Act is concerned, CBD remains illegal to possess or use as a medicine, and nearly impossible to use in clinical trials.
Hence the classification of cannabis as Part 1 substance is grossly inappropriate.
Key recommendations/Way forward
Other than bundle all varieties of cannabis in one basket, at policy and legislation levelthe distinction must be clearly drawn between the following two varieties of cannabis namely:
Industrial hemp: which is a raw material and contains little or no THC hence one cannot get the pleasure of smoking it to het high.
Despite long prohibition of all varieties of cannabis in Malawi, over 20,000 scientific studies published within the last 10 years have overwhelmingly confirmed that industrial hemp actually contains enormous economic and nutritional values.
There are new technologies which allow Industrial hemp as a raw material to be processed into bio-degradable plastics, construction materials, car/air craft body parts, clothing, oil, fuel, food, ropes, paper and many more important items.
Marijuana: which has high levels of THC that makes one high after smoking but also contains CBD which has enormous medicinal properties;
At both policy and legislation level, Industrial hemp must be appropriately recognized as an agricultural/cash crop owing to the enormous values it has as a raw material;
Despite believing that this would lead to a rise in use among teenagers, research carried out by Dr Deborah Hasin, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, and her colleagues dismissed these concerns, according to their paper in the journal Lancet Psychiatry.
After analysing data from a national study called Monitoring the Future, which collects information from 50,000 pupils aged13 to 18every year, they found there had not been a rise in use.
Dr Hasin said: “Our findings provide the strongest evidence to date that marijuana use by teenagers does not increase after a state legalises medical marijuana. Rather, up to now, in the states that passed medical marijuana laws, adolescent marijuana use was already higher than in other states.”
At both policy and legislation level, marijuana must then be re-scheduled (not legalized whole sale) from being Part 1 substance to Part 3 owing to its enormous medicinal values which have been unearthed by overwhelming scientific research.

Rastafarian man smoking cannabis
Cannabis is regarded as a “sacred commodity” by Rastas and they have been campaigning to have laws allow them to use and sell cannabis as part of their religious beliefs and culture.
Dung their routine search on the night of February 4, 2015, police found Pitilizani Lapukeni with the ‘luggage’ aboard a National Bus Company bus registration BQ 4132 going to Blantyre from Mzuzu.
“Soon after the bus arrived at Kaombe Police roadblock, all passengers disembarked for police search. In the process, they discovered five baskets put together and concealed in black plastic paper which contained the illicit drug,” said Nkhotakota Police spokesperson Williams Kaponda.
The weed is widely grown in Nkhotakota.
He added: “A few minutes later the man came to a police officer conducting the search and offered him K4 000 to let him pass with the dangerous drugs. This prompted the officers manning the roadblock to identify the owner of the baskets and was immediately arrested.”
The suspect has been charged with an offence of being found in possession of Cannabis Sativa without license contrary to section 4 (a) of Dangerous Drug Regulation and 19 (1) of the Dangerous Drug Act.
Lapukeni hails from Mbaluku village, Senior Chief Malengachanzi in the district and is expected to appear before Nkhotakota Magistrate Court soon.
Following such growing cases which have become rampant in the district, police have appealed to the general public to come forward with information that will lead to curbing the malpractice.
Police, further remind the general public that rewards are still being made to patriotic Malawians who come forward with information which lead to the arrest of the drug traffickers.
But the Rasta continue to argue that the constitution allows everyone’s entitlement to freedom of  religion, including Rastafarian which allows use of Chamba regarded as a “sacred commodity” and “sacrament incense” with authority for its use derived from the Bible.
They regard Chamba as a herb originally grown in the Garden of Eden for the use of mankind for religious, culinary and medicinal purposes.
And that they don’t sell Chamba in open market as they  do it in their “Rastafarian gatherings” comparing the practise of Christian churches holding summer fairs and coffee mornings for fund raising purposes.

“Two were arrested around midnight hours at Chasazima,” said Namwaza who also identified them as 45 year old Ireen Banda and Mercy Nyirenda,  both from Mazwoka village in Mzimba.
They were arrested after police got a tip that they had boarded a certain motor vehicle from the direction of Mzimba heading Kasungu.
“Following the tip, police detectives mounted a snap road block at  Chisazima where they managed to intercept the motor vehicle the two had boarded,” Namwaza added.
Upon searching the motor vehicle, police officers came across two bags fully loaded with loose Cannabis Sativa and the two suspects were arrested on the spot.
The other suspect, Jennifer Zulu, 35 of Zulu village, Traditional Authority Mkanda in Mchinji was also arrested at Kasungu Prison junction.
She was arrested after a well wisher informed police that the suspect who had a bag full of Chamba was in a certain lorry from Chatoloma direction heading Kasungu. Following the tip, police also  arrested Zulu.
The three will appear in court soon to answer charges of being found in possession of Cannabis Sativa.

Minister of Agriculture and Food Security, James Munthali told a local daily on Tuesday that Malawi was not ready to legalise the growing and use of  cannabis.
According to the Minister, cannabis grown in countries where it is being legalised  is not the same as the one grown in the country.
He further urgued that cannabis grown in Colorado has medicinal content and is, among others, used in the treatment of cases such as epilepsy.
Rasta march as they also demands that hemp should be legalised
But reacting to the Minister’s claims, Chinguwo, who once worked for the Malawi Congress of Trade Union (MCTU), argued that it was not only incorrect but also misleading the nation that marijuana grown in the country has not medicinal value at all compared to that of other countries.
“Marijuana is marijuana. Cannabis, regardless of variety, has medicinal value,” said Chinguwo.
He said Malawi stand to benefit a lot from a variety of cannabis called ‘Hemp’ as it has “enormous industrial uses as opposed to medical uses like marijuana.
“Malawi can therefore grow this variety of cannabis as a cash crop and export it elsewhere to earn the needed forex,” he advised.
Late last year, the Rastafarian community held peaceful demonstration to ask the government to consider legalising the growing and use of the illicit drug, which is being illegally grown across the country.

Written by Blessings Kang'ombe
Wednesday, 20/10/2021The Cannabis Regulatory Authority (CRA) says only four companies out of the 69 issued with licenses for medicinal and industrial hemp cultivation have started growing the crop in the country.
However, CRA Director-General, Dr. Ketulo Salipira told Zodiak Online that they expect the number to increase once the rain starts as a majority are hoping to depend on rain-fed while others are setting up irrigation facilities.
""We issued 69 licenses but only four are growing the crop now using irrigation farming. Once the rain begins the numbers are likely to increase,"" he said.
Dr. Salipira was however noncommittal on the volumes of the crop this season, claiming it will be known once a majority of the companies have also rolled out their activities.
An economic expert, Milward Tobias has tipped licensed companies and cooperatives to swiftly work on developing irrigation facilities as cannabis has the potential to boost the country's revenue base.
""The crop will boost our economy as there are markets already. Licensed companies and cooperatives need to enhance the development of irrigation facilities,"" he said.
According to CRA, four companies that have so far started growing the crop are Mchinji Cannabis Cooperatives, Invegrow Limited, CPG Investments, and Women of Vision.

Cannabis is regarded as a “sacred commodity” by Rastafarians
According to Police the suspects are Ras Mishack Banda, 52, as the leader of the group, Yohane Boniface, 25; Daniel Zulu, 21; Simeon Mwale,27; Zambika Masoadyera, 27; Langizo Siliya, 24; Chadaza Phiri, 23; Patrick Mhango, 23; Gelesomo Chemili,35; Kabungwe Mwale,35; Meshack John, 24; Jonathan Sakale, 22; John Biliati, 20; and Mathews Sitolo, 20.
They were arrested for misconduct at Guillime Police Unit in Mchinji district  following the arrest of their fellow two  Rastafarians for cultivating Indian hemp in their gardens, according to Mchinji Police Station spokesperson Lubrino Kaitano.
The Rastafarians in Mchinji  mobilised themselves in an attempt to rescue their friends from the police unit and  caused commotion  by, among other things, removing the police flag, claiming they  use and sell cannabis as part of their religious beliefs and culture.
They argued at the police unit that use of marijuana should be  recognised as part of Rastafarian culture and religion.
Rastafarians said they have a right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.
Cannabis is  regarded as a “sacred commodity” and “sacrament incense” with authority for its use derived from the Bible, according to the Rastafarian community.
The Rastafarians regard Chamba as a herb originally grown in the Garden of Eden for the use of mankind for religious, culinary and medicinal purposes.

Chilima and UTM officials at Nkhotakota
Crowds of people at Chilima, UTM Nkhotakota rally
Chilima said when he addressed a political rally of his UTM party in central region Indian Hemp growing district of Nkhotakota on Saturday.
“As UTM we want to look at the possibilities of using industrial marijuana for medical purposes as well as for farming. I hope you understand this clearly. There are different types of marijuana. In some countries, it is used for making medicine. Both the farming and the use of it are controlled.
“As UTM, we want to look into the possibility of doing the same here. We want to carry out research to see whether it is a viable trade for us, Malawians. I am talking about industrial marijuana – I hope you understand that clearly. I have not said start smoking it,” said Chilima.
He said there is a high demand of the herb, also known as cannabis sativa, saying Malawi should not be missing out of the opportunity.
It is estimated that one kilogramme of industrial hemp, fetches about K32 000 on the market and that there is potential direct annual benefit to Malawians in excess of K3 billion on 16.5 hectares.
Currently, Zimbabwe, Morrocco and South Africa are among African countries reported to have legalised the growing of industrial hemp.
Chilima, who broke ranks with the governing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to form the UTM said he will push to allow hemp farming to happen.
A Canadian investor in the cannabis industry, Graham MacKintosh of Green Quest Farmaceuticals, has since called on the country to legalise Indian hemp, for medical purposes to replace tobacco .
“There is a worldwide phenomenon taking place to legalise cannabis. If we can grow hemp on the higher side the economic benefits will be more than the normal tobacco but let us make sure the industry is regulated,” he said
He explained that there is a lot of value in using cannabis especially cannabidiol (CBD), a naturally occurring cannabinoid constituent of cannabis, which helps with pain relief, acts as an anti-seizure, combats anxiety and fights cancer.
“In the next three years, it is estimated that the demand for CBD oils will grow by 700 percent. So this is an opportunity Malawi should not miss,” MacKintosh said.
Parliament gave a go ahead for trials of industrial hemp at Chitedze Research Station and in Salima as studies are still ongoing on whether it can become a viable export product.
Among other issues  at the rally,  Chilima urged the people to keep safe their registration certificates so that they can vote next year.

0Police in the lake shore district of Nkhotakota have impounded 29 bags of cannabis sativa locally known as chamba that they found in an abandoned motor vehicle.
Nkhotakota police spokesperson William Kaponda confirmed this, saying: “The motor vehicle, a Toyota Carina-was abandoned on the night of March 11 2015 after the driver unexpectedly noted a snap roadblock erected by police. The driver dumped the car and disappeared, leaving the engine still running.”

Kaponda said after searching the vehicle, they found a driver’s licence as well as the bags of cannabis. The owner of the vehicle is yet to be identified.
Said Kaponda: “We encourage the public to refrain from drug-peddling to create a crime free Malawi since illicit drugs fuel criminal activities, especially among the youth.”
The spokesperson then appealed to the general public for information related to the abandoned motor vehicle and its contents since investigations are still in progress.
According to Kaponda, Nkhotakota ranks top on cannabis sativa related cases. In 2014, Nkhotakota police arrested 41 people for illegal possession of Indian hemp out of whom 28 were convicted. n

64,64,https://www.nyasatimes.com/of-chamba-politics-and-the-pursuit-of-economic-justice/,www.nyasatimes.com,Cannabis,"Of Chamba politics and the pursuit of economic justiceJune 13, 2021 Mahara Mhango Be the first to commentEncapsulated in the Chakwera Super hi5 political campaign blueprint were the inviting words; “Prospering together.”
These, ladies and gentlemen are not just mere words. This was a statement of extreme intent, a holy grail of all the campaign promises and the perfect most quintessence mantra of the Tonse agenda for change.
And if am not mistaken, it was the sole authoritative predicate. In fact it was this alluring assertion of a shared destiny that premised and anchored the whole narrative that our president and the vice president ran on heavily.
“Malawi okomera Tonse” was that one punch line that Tonse painted as a canvas of moral and ethical principle from which a selection of social goals would be drawn as they promised to tackle welfare economics for all.
So why the sudden change of heart?
For example, when the talk about the industry of cannabis, otherwise widely known as Chamba in vernacular, in Malawi became ripe, a lot of Malawians were so excited.
For the first time many envisaged a desirable future. Everyone was excited because whether this was by mere happenstance or not, it lined up well with what was promised; “prospering together!”
Sadly there was a complete departure and a breach of that commitment.
What was rolled out was not only licentious, but it dissipated every shred of that dream of prospering together.
In some unexplained ways our leaders had completely become notorious renegades, treacherously abandoning their own allegiance to the cause that they had vowed to fight for.
The hefty price tags on cannabis license fees and other requirements were immoral and plainly meant to bar common citizens from participating.
Just by the look of things, this government became only interested in giving easy access of our resources and tax breaks to the wealthy investors and those with a fat wallet.
Am not insinuating in any way that this is an industry that could be handled and managed by every jack and Jill in the country. But all I am saying is that Government should at least level the playing field for all.
Although its the first time Malawians are allowed to experiment and explore the market opportunities that cannabis will present, it is important to know that this is still a fast evolving industry that requires a type of smart approach and disciplined commitment with necessary knowledge.
Right now Malawi has four acceptable strains of industrial cannabis and six strains of medicinal cannabis and yet we have no Greenhouses and processing plants.
‘Enabled environment’
In other words we send our raw materials out and order them back into the country. By this, we are actually creating jobs in other countries while denying our people the same opportunity.
This is a backward strategy just like we have done with the rubber industry where we export raw materials in excess to RSA at a very cheap price and yet at the same time we import processed rubber at a very high cost from China.
Isn’t this a wasted opportunity for government to start building greenhouses and processing plants in Nkhotakota and other places so that our farmers can buy seeds at a cheaper price?
These plants could easily translate into increased employment rate and fulfill the 1 million job creation strategy. The Tonse administration needs to empower its local citizens to allow for increased jobs and economies of scale within the country.
Without a social capitalistic approach and some rigorous ways to firmly regulate quality, it will be impossible to stay committed to protecting the public health while also taking steps to improve the efficiency of regulatory pathways for the lawful use and marketing of appropriate derived products. We need a full redistributive approach and sound economic justice policies.
Without a social capitalistic approach and some rigorous ways to firmly regulate quality, it will be impossible to stay committed to protecting the public health while also taking steps to improve the efficiency of regulatory pathways for the lawful use and marketing of appropriate derived products.
When the Late Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda introduced Tobacco farming for example, he did knowingly that the crop he was introducing was one of the most difficult to produce and maintain, yet he was intentional on certain things and managed to make it the biggest forex earner for the nation.
What we need is a collective mind power to be about something with complete shifts in our perceptions, beliefs and desires for a shared prosperity.
For starters we can begin by emulating what the Late Kamuzu did with the smallholder farmers by promoting an idea of farmers clubs as small cooperatives and giving them adequate training and knowledge plus a loan facility to micro finance them so they’re free to compete and directly become the first in line to benefit.
I strongly suggest that this should be done in a way that is intentional to alleviate inequality and promote social economic justice and our focus should be on how we can harness these prevailing opportunities to create wealth for our people.
We need to foster an enabled environment for all Malawians to easily flourish and fabricate a sustainable and sufficient material foundation for a dignified and productive livelihood.
Instead of imposing these immoral high fees and making it almost impossible for the poor to participate, I suggest that government should consider introducing a progressive system.
‘Negative spillover’
Government should allow the tax percentages and licensing fees to increase progressively only as the base income amount increases.
In this way, government would be able to manage and remedy that income gap and inequality while at the same time affirmatively promoting fairness and justice.
All what government would be required to do is to manage risks so there would be no unnecessary interruptions and compliance failures.
By refusing to offer sound solutions that could reverse some of the hardships many Malawians face daily, they have allowed themselves to become complicit in cementing the widening gap between the haves and the have not.
If this Tonse government cannot change the conditions of human frailties and the unrelenting angst that is felt by our people, if Dr Chakwera and Dr Chilima will not champion for the weak amongst us, then I don’t know who will.
My humble plea to our government is that they will help us stop creating a society that seeks to run on a system that is heavily exploitative with such a wide divergence between the rich and the poor.
We need government policies to not only put emphasis on the individuals and maximum profits, but we need to put much emphasis on collective success and equity for all people.
The Tonse type of proclivity and economic predisposition should be the one that focuses on creating road maps to job creation and fairness.
We don’t need our scales to tip off one side just to only favor the powerful and the rich.
It’s not a hidden secret that most of these super wealthy investors will eventually externalize their forex and bank the proceeds outside Malawi.
What we are asking for is that government should remove barriers for ordinary Malawians (middle-and lower-income earners), create a way for many ordinary Malawians to compete effectively against wealthy investors in a manner that is fair and acceptable.
At all levels our economic objectives should be pro-poor with an intentional approach that aims to empower the bottom bracket so that they can directly participate, benefit and drive the economy up with such a robust trickle up phenomenon.
Let’s all remember that it’s those that are on the bottom, the working class and the poor that runs the engines of every working and healthy economy, and we need to reward them fairly by providing a level playing field for local individuals.
Most economists will agree that it’s the poorer that have “a higher “marginal propensity to consume” and they tend to spend more within the economy. This means that when more households are given a chance to thrive or to generate income, the nation collectively prospers.
The open free market ideologies that we are so much trying to obsess ourselves with can only work better in advanced economies not like ours.
We cannot burden ourselves with a policy that places a heavy demand to disproportionately reward those with capital advantage at the expense of the hard working poor Malawians.
This one sided approach that favours foreign investors and the rich is very toxic, and it’s negative spillover will trickle down and cost the marginalized in such an unjustified way.
The cannabis industry will by design, attract big money interest and if we don’t resolve the issues of economic justice first, we risk to create more problems without any counter measures and a proper strategy to control any protracted conflicts.
Don’t bring politics into the cannabis industry, think about the economic justice in it.
So long!

Indian hemp’s narcotic relative, also known to users as Malawi gold, is so popular

67,67,https://www.nyasatimes.com/malawi-must-legalise-indian-hemp-says-ras-judah-top-officials-sell-it/,www.nyasatimes.com,Cannabis,"Malawi must legalise Indian hemp, says Ras Judah: ‘Top officials sell it’February 28, 2013 Nyasa Times 67 CommentsLeader of Rastafarian for Unity, Ras Judah, says it’s time Chamba (Indian-hemp) drug was legalised for the benefit of the whole country.
He claimed   top government officials in the country are engaged in trafficking Indian-hemp.
“Haven’t you ever wondered that weed is an illegal trade but yet Malawi is one of the leading exporters of ganja to Europe, America and Asia? How does that happen?
“I will tell you: Using their power and positions, they get thousands of bags of weed passing illegally on roadblocks and borders when a common man like you and me get our hundred bags burned just to paint a rosy picture that they are doing something on it,” said Judah.
Ras Judah: Yeah man, legalise Cannabis
He was commenting in reaction to the burning of confiscated Indian hemp in Balaka district.
The Rastafarians argue that smoking the drug locally known as ‘chamba’ is part of their religious doctrine which must be respected and upheld.
But Cannabis is illegal in Malawi and police are sparing no one, Rasta or non-Rasta, in their crackdown on suspects.
The movement claims they are also Malawians who participate in the development of the country and should be treated equally.
He condemned the burning of Indian hemp which he said was the work of the devil, didn’t provide proof of his claims that Malawi officials deal in cannabis.
But he went on: “You see, I can challenge you, these people know the importance of [Chamba] and most of these high ranking officials are in this business.”
Malawi’s Chamba is said to be highly potent and fetches top dollar on that black market oversees.
“I must bring to your attention that Jah who is King of Kings gave us this plant. When Solomon asked for wisdom, Jah thought of something through which to impart that wisdom to him and that’s when he created weed,” he said.
Another controversial issue the Rastas want is to allow their children to attend classes in dreadlocks.
But Minister of Education Eunice Kazembe has said they can’t allow the practice, saying doing so would send a wrong message to other pupils.
She said Malawi school rules and regulations do not allow children to have plaited hair or dreadlocks.
Ras Judah said dreadlocks are a component of their religion and thus their children have a right to enroll in government schools, saying they will seek an audience with President Joyce Banda “so that we should be assisted.”
He said: “Yeah man, Rasta like any citizen has a right to education. Why discriminate against our children”
Rastafarians sought the intervention from the ministry of education after authorities at a school in Thyolo booted out Rasta children from school because they wore dreads.
Ras Judah said the late president Dr. Bingu wa Mutharika had instructed school heads in his home area- Thyolo- to allow Rasta children in government schools.
He said the continued ban of their children from school is depriving them of a right to education, contravening the UN charter on the rights of children.
The much-maligned sect also wants the Head of State to extend presidential appointments to members of Rastafarian community who may be equally competent and qualified for such positions.

68,68,https://www.nyasatimes.com/legal-hemp-can-boost-malawi-economy-experts/,www.nyasatimes.com,Cannabis,"Legal hemp can boost Malawi economy – ExpertsJuly 21, 2015 Nyasa Times Reporter 49 CommentsUniversity of Malawi economic professor based at Chancellor College in eastern city of Zomba, Ben Kalua has called for the de-politicization of production of Cannabis – locally known as Chamba- saying said industrial Hemp has the potential to steer the country’s economy towards recovery.
A presenter showing hemp products
He was speaking during a seminar organized by Kemet Forum at Chancellor College under the theme ‘Demystifying Cannabis’.
In his presentation Professor Kalua said the ban on Cannabis during the colonial days was purely political aimed at protecting the colonialists economic interests.
Kalua argued that research has shown that the gains outweigh the negatives in as far as production of this plant is concerned.
He said in the case of Cannabis which is used for smoking, there is a lot of research that has shown a lot of medicinal benefits from the plant.
The recent research which was led by Dr Yankel Gabet of Tel Aviv University, revealed that   Cannabis could be used in medicinal form to speed up the healing of broken bones.
Cannabis reportedly has a number of health benefits. A 2014 study found that THC reduced tumour growth in an aggressive strain of brain cancer within mice with virtually no psychotropic side-effects
Kalua said the misconception comes when the two are put together saying the hemp under discussion is not for smoking but for industrial purpose.
The Professor said smoking is a choice.
“Tobacco and alcohol are legal, why is that some do not smoke,” queried Kalua.
He asked government to give it a 5 year trial period of uncontrolled production of all the varieties and monitor the direction.
Ntchisi North Member of Parliament Boniface Kadzamira who raised the issue during the last sitting of parliament said time has come for Malawi to wake up and reap from its resources.
“What is honourable when people you represent are denied clear vibrant economic activities in favour of a century old falsehood and manipulated beliefs and legislation,” asked Kadzamira.
He said as a country it is high time Malawi started thinking outside the box and come up with alternative innovations that would boost the country’s revenue base.
Kadzamira said the country’s lack of progress is not due to lack of better ideas or alternatives but due to what he called a deliberate refusal to correct weak spots in the system.
He disclosed that the issue of Hemp has been in corridors of government for the last two years where an agreement was reached to offer license for trials to a certain company but wondered that when he introduced the subject in parliament the system feigned ignorance.
Kadzamira queried the secrecy, saying a transparent and accountable government could have informed the public on what is going on concerning the issue of industrial hemp in Malawi.
The MP said thousands of research has proved that hemp is not a drug but an agricultural cash crop with enormous economic potential capable of producing significant quantities of paper, building materials, sacks, medicines, paint, detergents, vanish, oils, ink, fuels, fabric and textiles, carpeting, biodegradable plastics, jewelry, auto parts, lubricants, beverages, nutritional foods and other things.
On fears that hemp smoking triggers madness, Kadzamira said the type of hemp being advocated for is industrial hemp which is used for manufacturing various things as mentioned above.
He said this hemp has little percentages of THC, a substance responsible for getting high in normal cannabis.
Kadzamira said this hemp is cultivated for its fiber, seeds and medicinal properties adding that it is very different from the smoking hemp.
The parliamentarian said for one to get the satisfaction of getting high they would need to smoke a cigarette the size of an electric pole.
The parliamentarian said apart from its economical benefits industrial hemp net benefits are quite impressive. He said Hemp grows in most climates with moderate water and fertiliser requirements.
Kemet interim chair Sangwani Msofi said it should be emphasized that the hemp being advocated for is pure industrial and not the one for smoking.
“I do not see why Malawi should struggle to improve its economy when it has valuable resource in hemp cultivation,” said Msofi.
He said hemp will bring the much needed forex adding that it can take over from tobacco. Msofi also said Kemet will keep on lobbying government to change its stance on Hemp for the betterment of Malawi.

The demonstration seeks “to push for justice in the Judiciary system to do with the case the 19-year-old Mussa John — who was given an 8-year custodial sentence for being found with cannabis while Harvey Milhade, Castel Malawi’s managing director — also found that he was cultivating the same illegal hemp — was just fined.
Chief Justice Mzikamanda
The CSO also wants to push for justice delivery on Norman Chisale, former chief of security for former President Peter Mutharika and also on business tycoon Choonara.
They are also to demonstrate to show their dissatisfaction on the delay to prosecute the case of the Republic v Kezzie Msukwa, who is answering allegations of corruption involving high profile suspect Zunneth Sattar.
“We demand to speed up all corruption cases [and that] all corrupt government officials be trialed on cameras/radios for the benefit of the masses.
“The CSO also contends that President Lazarus Chakwera should not hide behind his immunity as enshrined in the Republic’s Constitution.
The demonstration, scheduled from 10:00hrs, will start from Wakawaka M1 Road passing through Mchesi, Roundabout, Paul Kagame Road then to the Lilongwe High Court premises to hand over the petition to the Chief Justice.
“We thank you for your usual support and commitment to upholding human rights as provided in the Republic Constitution, subsidiary registrations and international instruments that Malawi is party to,” said the letter to Lilongwe District Council and copied to the Chief Justice and Ministry of Justice.
Meanwhile, an internal memo from acting Chief Resident Magistrate (South), Chisomo Msokera finds not defective teenager, Mussa John’s 8-year custodial sentence.
Dated June 27 under the subject ‘Confirmation and Supervisory Review of Sentencing in Rep. v John (criminal case number 475 of 2022) and Rep. v Milhade  and another criminal case number 567 of 2022’), the memo takes cognizance of the hot debate that ensued soon after John’s conviction.
“The social media is awash with debates on the propriety of an 8 years imprisonment sentence imposed on a 19-year-old convict on a charge of possession of cannabis sativa.
“There have been questions on whether the punishment meets the demands of distributive justice since retributive sentence appears, as some claimed, off tangent some of the sentencing trends by the magistracy where fines and not custodial sentences have generally imposed.
“One of such cited cases is Rep. v Milhade and another criminal case number 567 of 2022 where the convicts were sentenced to pay a fine of K1 million and in default to serve custodial sentence of 12 months on a charge of cultivating cannabis sativa.”
Msokera observed that the case of the teenager was heard in chambers of the Senior Resident Magistrate Court because there is no designated court room space at Limbe Magistrate Court but the chambers were used as open court.
“The charge is defective as it cites a wrong punishment provision and does not cite the statute book where the offence is provided for. Section 19(1)(a) and not section 16 of the Dangerous Drugs Act is the appropriate punishment provision; and the offence is created under the Dangerous Drugs Regulations.
“The Judgement on Sentence gives reasons as to why, not withstanding the dictates of Section 340 of the Criminal Procedures and Evidence Code, the convict deserves an outright custodial sentences.”
“Msokera also observed that “the Judgement on Sentence took into consideration the mitigating circumstances of the convict being a young person” and that “other than the irregular charge, this was a proper matter which should be forwarded to a superior court strictly for proceedings of review on confirmation under section 15 of the Criminal Procedures and Evidence Code”.
“Other than what I have specifically highlighted herein, the rest of the proceedings — as far as the court record is concerned — does not strike me as defective.
“In view of the cited irregularity and considering the perceive injustice of the sentence as it relates to Milhade and another, Msokera thus invokes section 26(1) of the Courts Act in asking for a “superior court to exercise its supervisory powers in addition to the review on confirmation proceedings over both matters”.
“It is my hope that the process of supervision and review on the confirmation by the High Court shall enrich our sentencing jurisprudence to aid the courts of magistrates in meting our appropriate sentences in cases of this nature.”

0Debate on whether Malawi should legalise the use and sale of chamba (cannabis sativa or Indian hemp) continues with Kemet Forum and other scholars organising a seminar to initiate an intellectual conversation on the issue.
The meeting will be held at the University of Malawi’s (Unima) Chancellor College in Zomba on Saturday July 18 2015, where some academics will help unpack whether there are any benefits the economy can accrue from the plant.
Reignited the debate: Kadzamira
One of the Kemet Foundation officials, Paliani Chinguwo, said in an interview the seminar comes after the realisation that although industrial hemp is indeed a form of cannabis, it only has trace amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the element in marijuana, another variety of cannabis that gets one high.
Kemet Forum is a network of citizens that critically discusses and disseminates hidden, distorted, misrepresented or unspoken truths about Africa.
Said Chinguwo: “One can’t smoke industrial hemp with the purpose of getting high the way people do with marijuana. So, the seminar is basically being convened to interrogate this and demystify this plant and examine whether there is literally nothing that Malawi can benefit from cannabis [particularly industrial hemp] as the law stipulates.”
At the seminar, the organisers will also display products from industrial hemp to be conducted by a company called Invegro, the first one to apply for a licence in Malawi to cultivate and process industrial hemp.
Ntchisi North member of Parliament Boniface Kadzamira (Malawi Congress Party-MCP), who will be one of the guest speakers, restarted the chamba debate in Parliament in May this year when he asked government to legalise the sale of chamba, saying it was a viable alternative to boost the country’s foreign exchange earnings.
Former MP and deputy minister of Agriculture in the Bakili Muluzi administration, Joe Manduwa, also raised the issue in Parliament in the early 2000s.

Chiyembekeza: President Mutharika has approved trials
Malawi will olny grow industrial hemp
The Minister has however said that the approval is for trial purposes in the country and explained that the industrial hemp is not the same as much talked about and known Indian hemp.
“Let me point out that industrial hemp is different from the much talked Indian hemp chamba or Cannabis Sativa] that is prohibited. This [industrial] hemp does not contain the psychoactive chemical elements that affect people when smoked even though it is from the same family of crops,” Chiyembekeza is quoted in a local paper.
Legalization of hemp has been of public debate in the country and during the last sitting of Parliament, it was also an issue in the House.
And University of Malawi economic professor based at Chancellor College in eastern city of Zomba, Ben Kalua said industrial Hemp has the potential to steer the country’s economy towards recovery.
Ntchisi North Member of Parliament Boniface Kadzamira who raised the issue during the last sitting of parliament said time has come for Malawi to wake up and reap from its resources.
The recent research which was led by Dr Yankel Gabet of Tel Aviv University, revealed that   Cannabis could be used in medicinal form to speed up the healing of broken bones.
Cannabis reportedly has a number of health benefits. A 2014 study found that THC reduced tumour growth in an aggressive strain of brain cancer within mice with virtually no psychotropic side-effects

Malawi hemp body chairperson Jere (right) lobby committee of parliament
The association led by its chairperson Chauncy Mopho Jere engaged the committee of parliament at Parliament Building in Lilongwe.
The meeting held on Wednesday was also attended by officials from Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA), Malawi Bureau of Standards (MBS) and Malawi Investment and Trade Centre.
Jere, who is also country operations director for Ikaros Africa, the company that promotes growing and processing industrial hemp, said Malawi is losing billions of kwacha in potential revenue.
He said industrial hemp has the biggest market that can boost Malawi economy.
Jere said Malawi Government was delaying the licence to enable his firm begin growing industrial hemp and process the crop into medicinal products with the absence of the legislation.
He said his company has been conducting trials in the country – with an investment of over K1.9 billion in three years -to assess the viability of growing cannabis.
This week Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development Principal Secretary Grey Nyandule Phiri said government will put in place the regulatory framework to govern growth and use of the industrial cannabis.
Said Nyandule Phiri: “No one has been given the licence. Government is putting the regulatory framework first, so everybody is waiting for that.”
He said the regulatory framework is expected to be finalised by the end of this year.

The bags containing the cannabis were weighing 50kgs each.
Moyo comes from Chipembe village in the area of traditional authority Mpezeni, Chipata district in Zambia.
Mzimba police spokesperson Gift Nyirongo told Nyasa Times that on 1st August, detectives from Champhira police post received a tip from a driver who was hired by the suspect to ferry the illicit drug to Lundazi, Zambia.
The driver (name withheld) told police that he was hired by the suspect to transport Indian hemp to Lundazi and that they would set off at mid night.

”And working on the tip, the police laid in ambush and at around mid night they arrested the suspect and seized 17 bags of Chamba weighing 50kgs each,” said Nyirongo.
The police spokesperson said Moyo has since been charged with the offence of being found in possession of Cannabis Sativa contrary to regulation 4(a) as read with section 19(1) of the dangerous drug act.
He will appear in court soon to answer the charges.
In June this year, Malawi police also arrested a Zambian woman Hildah Phiri for being found in possession of 6 bags of Chamba each weighing 90kgs which was also about to be ferried to Lundazi, Zambia.
The woman is remanded at Mzimba Prison.
Cases of Chamba are rampant in Mzimba especially around Mgoza and Khosolo areas where the illicit drug is extensively cultivated.
Meanwhile, police in Mzimba are thankful to members of the general public for tipping them on various criminal activities happening which has led to the bust up of habitual criminals.

0Government last week announced that President Peter Mutharika had approved the cultivation of industrial hemp for trial purposes. The approval was a culmination of a sustained campaign by disparate groups of individuals who extolled the benefits of cultivating the crop to the country’s economic well-being.
But can industrial hemp alone turn the fortunes of Malawi?
The confiscated bags of cannabis sativa (chamba) at
Police Station
“Industrial hemp alone cannot be a nostrum for the country’s economic problems. In fact, no crop can single-handedly do this, but with well focussed and supported research, hemp can stimulate tremendous benefits to the economic landscape as the crop has viable positives,” says Ntchisi North Member of Parliament Boniface Kadzamira who has been championing the legalisation of cultivation of industrial hemp in the country.
His strong stance on the plant has resulted in an increased momentum and significant shift in perceptions of the crop.
The case of whether or not to grow industrial hemp has attracted a lot of controversy, particularly over misconceptions that it is the same as legalising Indian hemp (cannabis sativa).
But in announcing Mutharika’s nod, Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development Allan Chiyembekeza parried away those suggestions in an interview with our sister paper, The Nation: “Let me point out that industrial hemp is different from the much talked Indian hemp [chamba or cannabis sativa] that is prohibited. This [industrial] hemp does not contain the psychoactive chemical elements that affect people when smoked even though it is from the same family of crops.”
It was an announcement that struck a chord with Kadzamira.
Rastas call for legalisation of Indian hemp
“My argument has been that misconceptions about the plant overshadow its economic capacity including its varying pliancy to different industrial uses. Hemp has a huge commercial heritage and it must be understood that industrial hemp isn’t marijuana and there are very clear and easily perceptible differences,” he states.
The lawmaker affirms that there is an emerging market for hemp which must be taken advantage of.
“No money would be spent on enforcement laws against its cultivation. There will also be a lot of jobs created and as a result this will lead to a robust economy because those employees will be paying taxes,” he states.
Kadzamira is also upbeat about the salient characteristics of the crop.
“An acre of hemp produces more paper than pulp wood and this is also on an environmental side. Suppose we want to use it for paper, we won’t cut down trees for paper production. Industrial hemp takes only three to four years to mature and be ready for paper while a tree takes more than five years. Economically, there will also be a saving because we will simply engage communities to plant the herb and there will be no need to deploy soldiers to guard trees,” he adds.
Paliani Chinguwo, a hemp advocate, underscores the fact that hemp does not require fertilisers to grow, hence there will be a saving on forex used to import fertiliser.
“For the country to realise maximum economic benefits, we need to invite industries to come and establish industries so that they can be producing items like paper, sacks, medicines, hair and body lotions and many others right in the country. People must also understand that almost all products made from Soya beans such as milk, butter and flour can also be made from the crop,” said Chinguwo.
He went further to deplore prohibition which has been used by politicians to deter and prevent the social use of mind-altering substances deemed to be unsuitable for wider public use.
“In the US, for instance, prohibition was deeply unpopular with the public opinion of free-choice, and it gifted control of alcohol supply and all ensuing untaxed revenues to criminal gangs. This money was then used to amplify and fund criminal activities in other areas of society.
“Despite these findings, most countries have persisted with prohibition as the preferred system for cannabis even though the only beneficiaries are criminal gangs. But it’s my hope that this won’t be the case in this country,”.
But Jones Makuwira, a Lilongwe-based economist, warns that hemp cannot produce immediate miracles.
“It’s an economic risk in a way and you can’t expect an economic revolution quickly without putting up proper measures to guard against misuse. Elsewhere it has brought chaos because only a few and rich people benefit from its cultivation,” says Makuwira."

Trade balance soars to record-$629.6 million

Sosten Gwengwe
The country’s appetite for foreign goods and services continues to grow despite its failure to sell significant volumes of locally produced products and services to the rest of the world, witnessed by a -$629.6 million (about K478 billion) record high trade balance recorded at the end of the last quarter of 2020.
According to a financial and economic review, published by the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) recently, between the months of October and December 2020, the country imported goods and services worth $833.6 million while exporting goods and services worth $204 million.
The trade balance represents a 41 percent increase when compared to the -$446.5 recorded in the last quarter of 2019.

The trend has been consistent in previous years, characterised by the country’s failure to maximize earnings from the export market.
Chancellor College Economics Professor Ben Kalua said Malawi’s export basket remains narrow to register meaningful exports.
He said the problem had been compounded by the country’s failure to diversify the agriculture sector let alone the entire economy.

“We have been slow in damping tobacco and embracing opportunities such as cannabis. We need to embrace such because UK is currently the biggest exporter of cannabis but it does it in greenhouses while here it grows freely and it is a multi-trillion dollar produce,” Kalua said.
In a separate interview, Minister of Trade Sosten Gwengwe said the figures may not represent the situation on the ground as exports data are rarely captured in the country while imports data are heavily reported.
“What we record as exports is not a true reflection of what we send out of the country but, still, we have the National Export Strategy 2 which will keep on encouraging exporters to do more,” Gwengwe said.
The Malawi economy hugely relies on the agriculture sector despite the industry being underdeveloped.

Chamba peddlers in Nkhotakota with their bags containing the ‘golden leaf’
While the Nkhotakota operation was done by the Police and Game Rangers, the Kasungu operation was by the Police and the Courts simply because the latest case was under the courts confinement. In Nkhotakota the drug was found in a farm in a game reserve and was destroyed in the gardens.
Part of the Kasungu consignment was confiscated from Mbiriyakula Maliko and two others at Kalenga Trading Centre in the Area of Traditional Authority Wimbe in the district.
The other was found by the Police at Chisazima and Bua roadblocks.
The owners were however not traced but Malio and his colleagues convicted and fined K50, 000 each by the Kasungu Magistrate Court.
Kasungu Police Public Relations Officer Edwin Kaunda confirmed of the development which comes at a time when Malawi President Peter Mutharika approved the cultivation of industrial hemp.
Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development Allan Chiyembekeza said  the approval is for trial purposes in the country and that the industrial hemp is not the same as much talked about and known Indian hemp.

Indian hemp legalization debate took a center stage across the country and three months ago the issue was even raised in Parliament for debate, and the minister explained last month that should the trials be successful, the industrial hemp will be another source of foreign exchange earnings.

Smoking cannabis can increase the risk of severe coronavirus symptoms, medics have warned.
The virus causes Covid-19, a respiratory disease that can progress from mild illness to viral pneumonia and organ failure.
Doctors say cannabis leads to inflammation in the lungs, which affects the body’s ability to fight off the virus.
They did not mention any side effects from smoking tobacco.
“What happens to your airways when you smoke cannabis is that it causes some degree of inflammation, very similar to bronchitis, very similar to the type of inflammation that cigarette smoking can cause,” pulmonologist Dr Albert Rizzo, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association, told CNN.
Some studies and anecdotal reports suggest marijuana can help people cope with anxiety, which is being felt deeply across the world as the coronavirus pandemic continues.
But lung health experts warn that smoking marijuana regularly could increase a person’s risk of contracting Covid-19, and also having more severe symptoms and complications from the disease,
Additionally, physicians say using cannabis could make it harder for symptoms of Covid-19 to be diagnosed.
This is because one of the symptoms is a dry cough, but that same cough can be brought on by using weed.
It’s well-known that those with chronic lung diseases, such as COPD, are among the most at risk of suffering severe complications from coronavirus.

However, before passing the sentence magistrate Buleya schooled the convict to be exemplary .
“We expect you as the law enforcers to be the exemplary in respecting the laws that you enforce. Hence a stiff punishment is required for you for others to learn a lesson,” Said Buleya.
He went on to sentence Andrew Mitochito pay a fine of K100, 000 or in default serve two year Imprisonment with Hard Labour (IHL).
Mitochi was arrested on Monday 19, this year at Kaombe roadblock when he was travelling from Dwangwa heading to Lilongwe on Dihatsu Mira Salon registration number IT 6496.

Harawa, who is also manager of the reggae outfit The Black Missionaries, said in an interview with Times TV ‘Tikudziweni‘ program host Brian Banda that he knows Cabinet Ministers, top government officials and lawyers who smoke Marijuana popularly known as Chamba.
“Are you not surprised that when the issue of Chamba trials was presented in parliament it passed without any difficulties?” said Harawa in the interview monitored by Nyasa Times.
Harawa said there are many people he knows in the security organs who use the drug.
When asked by Banda if he had ever smoked cannabis, Harawa said he had, “occasionally in my youth” but never since.
“I am a Rasta but  Rastafarianism is not about smoking weed. There are so many people who call themselves Rasta but they don’t smoke weed, including myself,” said Harawa.
“I have been a Rasta for more than 30 years but I don’t smoke hemp. I used to smoke in the past but I stopped,” he said in the interview.
Harawa backed calls for a regulated cannabis market in the country as many believe Malawian hemp could be worth billions of dollars in a rapidly expanding global market for legal weed.
“I support the practice of smoking Indian hemp for recreation,” he said.
Harawa, married to a British doctor, said Chamba smoking is helping government to reduce numbers of people committing suicide as some people find solace in weed.
Malawi is well known for the prevalence and quality of marijuana production within its borders, including the sought after “Malawi Gold” strain.
There is growing interest in cashing in on a valuable crop. But in each case there are unique challenges to face as critics of legalizing hemp have suggested that marijuana could be next, a longstanding demand of the country’s Rastafarian minority, which claims that smoking ‘chamba’ is integral to their culture.
Marijuana is illegal in Malawi and police are sparing no one, Rasta or non-Rasta, in their crackdown on suspects.
But the Rastafarian community held peaceful demonstration to ask the government to consider legalising the growing and use of the illicit drug, which is being illegally grown across the country.
One Rasta quoted from the bible, citing Genesis 1 verses 11 and 12, as authorising people to smoke the “herb”, which he also claimed had medicinal properties.
“So, yeah man, Then God said, ‘I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth.’” (Genesis 1:29, NIV)
He said while the Holy Bible does speak of alcohol, it never mentions marijuana, which means the issue requires a great deal of consideration before arriving at a thoughtful Christian position.

Indian hemp’s narcotic relative, also known to users as Malawi gold, is so popular
The two, 38-year-old John Chinyama and Idani Phiri 19 years old, were arrested at Mapira Trading Centre few kilometers from Lizulu Trading Centre along Lilongwe-Blantyre M1road.
Ntcheu police Public Relations Officer, Hastings Chigalu said the suspects were arrested by patrol officers.
“Our officers were patrolling along the  M1 road between Tsangano turn-off and Lizulu Trading Centre, and upon reaching Mapira trading centre , they found a dark blue Nissan Tiida registration number NS 6328 that was on break down,” explained Chigalu.
He added: “Considering that motorists have been attacked of late on this road, the officers stopped to assist them. While in the process of assisting them, it’s when they discovered that the vehicle was carrying the illicit drug.”
The suspects were on transit from Dwangwa to Mulanje district.
“They were arrested, the drug seized and the vehicle was impounded.”
Meanwhile, the marijuana has been sent to Chitedze Research Station for examination.
Chinyama hails from Kondamiri village, T/A Kanyenda while Phiri hails from Kalimukhola village, Traditional Authority Kanyenda in Nkhotakota district.

The award winning music icon Katimba made the plea on Thursday after High Court Judge Vikochi Chaima in Blantyre reduced Mussa’s jail term from 8-years to 3-years imprisonment.
“As a nation particularly the youths, we are crying and begging you to act within your stipulated powers to pardon the young boy MUSSA JOHN who has been sent to prison for reasons better known to the prosecutor and Judges,” wrote Katimba in an open letter to Chakwera posted on his official Facebook page.
Katimba further said: “Your Excellency, I am not in any way condoning lawlessness because “a crime is a crime” regardless of who commits it, BUT SELECTIVE JUSTICE IS EQUALLY EVIL and that’s why we are standing against it without fear.”
In related development, celebrated hip-hop artist Fredokiss born as Penjani Kalua has organised ‘Free Mussa’ protests aimed at forcing President Chakwera to pardon the convicted teen.
“We are planning a Youth Parade. A Solidarity walk to display our stand against Selective Justice.
This one is for John Mussa,” said the Ghetto King Fredokiss in one of his Facebook posts adding: “We will parade and deliver the letter to the Father of the Nation at Sanjika palace.”
Mussa was convicted and sentenced to 8 years imprisonment in June this year a legal action did not satisfy the general public, arguing that some people who committed offences of similar nature got lenient penalties.

The Blantyre senior resident magistrate court this week sentenced Mussa John to eight years imprisonment with hard labour for being found in possession of 78 plastics of chamba weighing 134 kilograms.
Convicted boy
Some lawyers have shown interest to seek a review of a matter probono.
Counsel Alexious Kamangira says he has already met Mussa in his preliminary investigation of the matter before taking it up to the Chief Resident Magistrate in Blantyre.
On the other hand, executive director for the Centre for Human Rights Education, Advice and Assistance (CHREAA), Victor Mhango, said they will meet the convict on Monday on the same cause.
Mhango says they will be responding to a call by some citizens to intervene on the matter, saying a fine or a suspended sentence would have been fair to the suspect being a first offender and considering his age.

Lawyers representing John presented eight grounds for the review.
Among the grounds of the appeal, the lawyers argue that the convict was given an excessive custodial sentence for a 19-year-old in the light that there was no actual possession of the illicit drug and that the  Magistrate Court erred in law for accepting a plea contrary to the statement recorded from the convict.
In its submission, the State agreed with the defence that the sentence was excessive, however, argued that the custodial sentence was proper and must only be reduced and not quashed.
John was convicted last month and he is serving an eight-year jail sentence.

Conviction upheld but reduced to 3 months
His mother wept uncontrollably after the verdict, and was restrained by court marshals when she was advancing the judge’s bench.
Mother crying uncontrollably
The High Court was the scene of uncontrollable weeping and wailing as she asked the court to jail her instead.
Mussa was on 15 June 2022 arrested for being found with 78 plastic bags of Indian Hemp at his home.
When he appeared before the Court, he pleaded guilty to the offence, which led to the court to sentence him to eight years.
He has over the last few months been seeking the court to quash his conviction and set aside his sentence.
Among others he argued that the Magistrate Court erred in accepting his guilty plea despite indicating in his caution statement, that he was not in possession of the Indian Hemp.
His pro bono lawyers said they would appeal against the ruling.
Some people said it is only the poor who are sent to jail on being found in possession with chamba while the rich and powerful are fined.

Mazizi against legal Indian Hemp in Malawi.-Photo-by-Rehoboth-Multimedia
Wonders shall indeed never end and on the mention of the subject, Nkhotakota Central Constituency MP Peter Mazizi says government should not legalise the weed and according to him, this call is purely “nonsensical” coming from sullen people.
“I don’t think that’s a good move for government to legalise Chamba because this plant is very strong and most of our boys have gone mad and certainly, I disagree with our friend who brought this issue forward in parliament,” he told Nyasa Times in an exclusive interview..
“He might have highlighted all the good uses of Chamba and how he believes it will boost the economy of the country, but what he has failed to put into account are the effects of Chamba which we all know are far more deadly to our boys and everyone that smokes,” explained Mazizi.
Calls to legalise Chamba originated from Malawi Congress  Party (MCP) lawmaker for Ntchisi North, Boniface Kadzamira who said Chamba is a “viable alternative that can help drive in forex  into Malawi.”
“An acre of Marijuana produces more paper than wood pulp or tree. Apart from paper, you can produce fibre, fabric, soap, lighting oil, medicines, food oil and proteins for both humans and animals,” said Kadzamira
Malawi Gold is the name given to cannabis originating in Malawi. In Chichewa, it is locally known as Chamba. It is internationally renowned as one of the finest sativas from Africa.
The Malawi Health Equity Network (Mhen), the Drug Fight Malawi have called for proper research on the proposal while prominent University of Malawi professor of economist, Ben Kalua, argues that industrial hemp fibres are used to manufacture a wide-range of items like textiles, cosmetics, specialised concrete applications and medicines.
He said industrial hemp has enormous potential as an agricultural crop, saying people don’t understand the economic benefits of industrial hemp because of the confusion caused with the illicit drug – Chamba.

Why me? Chamba farmer
Lyton Lunda, 91, his two sons Nervason, 74, and Alufeyo, 61, were arrested Thursday last week at Nthapangwa Lunda Village, T/A Kampingo Sibande in the district.
On Monday, police prosecutor Sergeant Snowden Chimombo told the court that the three were arrested following a tip by one of the members in the village.
“The police uprooted about 300 plants of cannabis which were found in their garden. The hemp was taken to Lunyangwa research station where it was tested and weighed 456 kilograms, including stems, seeds and roots,” Chimombo said.
The Lundas pleaded guilty to the charge of violating regulation 6(1) as read with 19(1) of the Dangerous Drugs Act and were subsequently convicted.
Chimombo said though they were all first offenders and aged, there was need for a stiffer punishment to serve as a lesson to other ganja farmers in the district.
“The convicts are old people who are responsible in society. The first accused is the village headman which means he was supposed to act responsibly and be exemplary to young ones,” he said.
In mitigation, they all pleaded with the court to exercise leniency saying they are aged and responsible for orphans.
They further promised the court never to engage in Marijuana farming again.
In his ruling, First Grade Magistrate George Longwe told the court that the offence is very serious and needed a stiffer penalty.
He, however, said the court considered charging them using section 340 of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Code.
According to the section, for first offenders, before imposing a prison sentence, a court must, by a process of elimination, rule out that a non-custodial sentence is not the proper way of dealing with the offender.
In deciding that question, the section further says the sentencing court may regard the youth, old age, character, home surroundings, health or mental condition of the accused, among other factors.
“The offense is very serious, but these are first offenders, and elderly; the oldest being 91 and the youngest being 61. In addition, they have repented that they will not do it again,” Longwe said.
He, therefore, used section 337(1) of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Code and discharged them on condition that they should not committee any offence within 12 months.

Kadam’manja, who is also Nyasa Big Bullets FC  supporters  committee treasurer, is not a first offender in possession of chamba but was previously let scot free because he was at one time among the security detail of the ruling party  to  Minister responsible for Disaster Management Affairs, Everton Chimulirenji.
Salima Police spokesperson, Jacob Khembo, said they arrested Kadam’manja in the early hours of Monday .
Khembo said Kadam’manja packed chamba in a minibus, which he was allegedly transporting from Dwangwa, Nkhotakota District, to Blantyre.
He said police  arrested Kadam’manja after mounting a roadblock at Mlamba area on M5 Road, which connects Salima and Balaka.
“Upon acting on a tip-off, we mounted a roadblock and when the vehicle reached the roadblock, the search was done where we found the hemp,” Khembo said.
Meanwhile, Khembo said the suspect was taken to Salima Second Magistrate’s Court where he was granted bail.
He is answering a charge of allegedly being found in possession of Indian hemp contravening Section 19(1) of the Dangerous Drug Act.
The Indian hemp will be taken to Chitedze Research for certification.

“The police immediately after receiving the tip rushed to the scene and found two nursery beds of the prohibited plant each bed measuring two and a half metres,” Kagwira told the court.
Lucius was arrested and the illicit seedlings which had reached transplanting stage were uprooted and tendered in court as part of evidence.
The accused pleaded guilty and admitted to the charge laid against him. In mitigation, Lucius pleaded for a lenient punishment, claiming that he looks after a big family.

Chaponda L and the Trade and Industry Minister Joseph Mwanamveka: Hemp OK as rope, not as dope
Leader of the House George Chaponda, who is also minister of Agriculture and President Peter Mutharika’s right hand man was among the senior cabinet ministers who supported a private motion by Ntchisi north MP Boniface Kadzamira which was seeking the House to legalise the growing of the hemp.
Chaponda, who is also Mulanje South West MP said: “People from Mulanje South West would like to have it legalised but there is need to have a new vernacular name.”
He said the ministry of Agriculture through Chitedze Research Station is doing a research on the industrial hemp.
Chaponda, however wondered why it is grown in European and Asian countries including UK, China, Japan, Austria but in Africa it is grown in Egypt alone.
Minister of Trade and Industry, another powerful minister in Mutharika’s administration said the value of growing the hemp are very good.
“This crop will help Malawi move from its current position of dominantly importing nation to a dominantly exporting nation,” he said.
However, he suggested there should be legislations that would control, monitor and regulate the growth to avoid abuse.
Minister of Health Peter Kumpalume, one of the trusted ministers of Mutharika said there was need to ensure that only the right variety of the hemp is grown as indian hemp and industrial hemp come from the same family of the crop.
He agreed with others that the hemp will be useful in making cooking oil, manufacturing materials, cosmetics, clothes, among others.
Mzimba north MP told the House that Malawians should embrace this new crop saying religious and cultural beliefs should not make people fear scientific research as the country needs innovation and technology if it is to move forward.
Kadzamira told the House that the plant has enormous economical, medical and nutritional values and should be allowed to be grown.
He said all farmers wishing to grow the plant would be registered and monitored, saying this would in the long run replace tobacco which is facing a smoky future.
Kadzamira said the Linguistics Department at Chancellor College will come up with a better vernacular name other than chamba.
The motion received overwhelming support from both the government and opposition sides.

Indian hempMalawi Parliament"
105,105,https://mwnation.com/industrial-hemp-is-not-chamba/,mwnation.com,chamba,"‘Industrial hemp is not chamba’by Frank Namangale 21/06/2016 in National News 2 min read
0  Parliament on Thursday adopted a motion to legalise the farming of industrial hemp, but a human rights activist has warned that it must not be mistaken for Indian hemp, locally known as chamba.
Billy Banda, one of the advocates of the cultivation of industrial hemp, said in an interview on Saturday that elsewhere, companies use industrial hemp to make lightweight material that looks like a floor mat.
He said suppliers for auto manufacturers—such as Ford, Mercedes Benz and General Motors—buy sheets of the material, which is heated and moulded into door panels, trunk liners and other interior vehicle parts, emphasising the economic gain of the hemp.
The passing of the motion in Parliament, which will now await President Peter Mutharika to assent, has brought some excitement among Malawians that chamba, which is illegal, would now be cultivated for high economic gains.
Banda, who is executive director of Malawi Watch, warned that people should not mistake industrial hemp for chamba, adding that the difference between the two is huge.
Banda: The difference between the two is huge
He said people cannot get high by smoking the so-called industrial hemp because it has only a trace amount of the same psychoactive ingredient found in marijuana.
Banda said: “Of course, chamba growers can take advantage of this legislation because it is difficult to differentiate marijuana and industrial hemp. Government is also expected to give proper guidance on variety of the hemp to grow.”
The activist said he expected government to give proper guidance when issuing licences for farmers to cultivate it, warning handling it wrongly may promote the growing of the illegal chamba.
According to our research on www.southbendtribute.com, industrial hemp can be grown for its seed or fibre. Among other things, it is used to make food products, clothing, paper, plastics and composite materials that can be found in skateboards, cars and aircraft bodies.
It can also be used to produce hemp oil, seeds and crackers.
The search reveals that hemp is commonly found in northern Indiana in the United States of America, where it grows wild each year and has been difficult for authorities to eradicate.
Its origin in the region goes back to the early 1940s when the US government planted it to aid the World War II effort. Its strong fibre material was used to make parachute cords.

Indian hemp’s narcotic relative, also known to users as Malawi gold, is so popular
According to the MP, Boniface Kadzamira (Malawi Congress Party) apart from paper, “hemp can be used to produce fibre, fabric, soap, lighting oil, medicines, food, oil and proteins for both humans and animals.”
But Minister of Agriculture and Water Development, who was not present in parliament at the time, told The Nation that he “he had no comment.”
He insisted that “what Kadzamira said was his opinion” and that “government does not take opinions as policies.”
This is the second time the issue has come up in the Malawi parliament. In April 2000, Jon Manduwa, then deputy minister of agriculture had made a similar proposal.
Manduwa had argued that Malawi would benefit a great deal economically if Chamba could be legalized.
Commentators say that Malawi’s variety of Chamba is one of the best in the world.
Despite growing and being found in possession of Chamba is illegal in Malawi, hardly weeks pass without truckloads of the same being impounded by police.
The .botanical.com posits that hemp has several uses including medicine which can be used for easing pain and inducing sleep or for soothing influence in nervous disorders.
In 2013 Rastafarian community held peaceful demonstration to ask the government to consider legalising the growing and use of the illicit drug, which is being illegally grown across the country.

This came after the police at KIA on Thursday also intercepted another package of chamba (Cannabis sativa) weighing 4kg posted from Harare, again, en route to an address in London, UK.
Both the Thursday and Saturday packages were posted through Kenyan Airways flying to the United Kingdom through KIA, according Sgt. Sapulain Chitonde, spokesperson for KIA Police.
The chamba was packaged in form of cakes and wrapped in carbon papers spread with hot pepper outside apparently to kill the drug’s notable smell, according to Chitonde.
But unlike the Thursday package which bore the name, Clayton Hickey, as the one who posted it in Harare and Richard Peterson as the recipient in London, the Saturday package had Mary Jackson, and Paul Jackson, as the sender in Harare and receiver in London respectively.
“We have not yet made any arrest in connection with the chamba packages but we are currently communicating with our counterparts in Zimbabwe to work together in tracing the culprits,” said Chitonde.
Between September and November 2015 KIA handled over 10 similar cases except that the parcels were posted from Blantyre to various destinations in Europe mostly via Ethiopian Airways.
During the same period, Police in Blantyre arrested Nigerian national, Mzee Chidiebere at Blantyre Post Office on suspicions that he was behind the posting of the packages of chamba to Europe.
Importation, exportation, possession or consumption of chamba is illegal in Malawi under Sec. 11 (A) of the Penal Code as read with Regulation 19 of Dangerous Drug Act, according to Chitonde.

0Kamuzu International Airport (KIA) Police on Tuesday intercepted chamba (Cannabis sativa)  headed for Europe.
This comes barely a week after another lot bound for Dublin, Ireland was intercepted at the airport while another lot also heading to Europe was intercepted on Tuesday.

KIA Police spokesperson Sapulain Chitonde confirmed the incident in an interview. He said the chamba was in two separate packages posted from Blantyre to two addresses in the UK.
“One package weighing 4.4kilogrammes was posted by a woman in Blantyre going to Yorkshire, while the other package weighing 4.7kg was going to London,” explained Chitonde.
Like the other package that was confiscated, the two packages were wrapped in metal paper foil and concealed in fine art books.
According to Chitonde, smugglers believe that metal paper foil bars X-ray security machine from detecting contents of a package.
Police are still investigating to establish the identities of the senders and the intended recipients of the prohibited drug.
Sale, exportation and consumption of chamba is prohibited under sections four and 19 of Dangerous Drugs Act and those found are charged with Illegal Exportation of Dangerous Drugs, according to Chitonde."

The Rastafarians argue that smoking the drug locally knowns as ‘chamba’ is part of their religious doctrine which must be respected and upheld.
It is not wrong neither an offence in a democratic country like Malawi for the general public to ask the government to provide and respect their rights, because respecting the rights of the citizens is the main legal responsibility of the government. However, the important question to be answered here is; what does the concept of minority rights connote and who are the minority? Scholars of sociology define Minority as a subordinate group whose members have significantly less control or power over their lives than members of a dominant or majority group. The marginalized people in the society fall in the same category.  In the context of Malawi, the minority can be the Rastafarians, prostitutes, gays , lesbians and etc.
Rastafarians say their religion allows them to smoke the ""herb""
According to Rastafarians, it is their right to smoke and make use of Chamba. This call is within the premises of respecting the rights of the minority. The inference of this argument simply put that sex workers and other so called marginalized groups of people in the country should also fight for their rights from the government within the umbrella of respecting the minority rights. Is this what Malawi need?
Lubani:
it is not true to argue that Muslims use Lubani for worshiping as claimed by Rastafarians. The truth of the matter is that Muslims use Lubani as a fragrant or an air freshener that brings nice aroma in their houses, shops, offices or praying places. So comparing Chamba to Lubani is not a reasonable argument.
Additionally, I believe that Malawians have never complained at any point that Lubani is causing problems in their neighbourhood. But the case is different when we look at the impact of Chamba in the society hence declared illegal to use it.
Vote:
Threatening or blackmailing the government to legalize Chamba or to normalize the abnormal is morally wrong. It is not only Rastafarians who cast their votes in Malawi hence blackmailing the President in the name of votes is unacceptable stratagem.
Gays , Lesbians, armed robbers,  pang-thugs and even witchcrafts they also vote. So should the government legalize such immoral behaviours simply because the President wants to have their votes?
In wrapping up, I believe that if it is true that Malawi is a God fearing nation as it is proudly pronounced by all Malawians; the government will not at any cost legalize the illegal habits which promote immoral behaviours in the country.
What we should know is that once the government allow such depraved practices in the name of respecting the minority rights, Malawi should expect to experience what other societies do where man can take an animal as a partner.
Hopefully Malawians are not ready for that.

After ‘proving’ she smokes chamba, Davido makes peace with baby mama, Sophia Momodu

After a public spat where he accused her of smoking chamba and endangering their child’s health, Nigerian music superstar, Davido has now reportedly made peace with the mother of his 8-month-old daughter.
According to The Daily Sun, the Aye hit-maker has buried the hatchet with his baby mama, Sophia Momodu, putting an end to the media war that has seen both parties trade accusations over poor parenting.
The duo reportedly agreed on the truce following the intervention of their parents and lawyers in a meeting convened at National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Person (NAPTIP) offices.

Davido’s tycoon father, Deji Adeleke, Mr. and Mrs. Dele Momodu, and their legal counsels agreed to resolve the custody battle amicably, with each side promising to refrain from heated media exchanges.
The NAPTIP officials present during the negotiations reportedly advised Davido’s family to give the young mother access to baby Imade.
The former flames got into a bitter custody war after the 23-year-old music star attempted to take his daughter, Imade Adeleke, to Dubai on December 30 without Momodu’s consent.

Davido was denied clearance by the airport authorities who stated that the child’s mother had not given formal consent for the baby to be taken out of the country as required by law.
Offering an explanation for the trip, Davido said that he was rushing his daughter to Dubai for medical treatment after Momodu ‘poisoned’ their child through her breast milk that was contaminated with cannabis.
The music star claimed that Mamodu smoked bhang, and he event went as far as publishing lab results online.
The 27-year-old refuted allegations by Davido that she smokes bhang, adding that the allegation cannot be used as a reason to take baby Imade away from her.

With Fanwell Kenala Bokosi:
The economics of political campaigns is about making wild claims about how, if voted into power, someone will make life better for all of us. Some of the rhetoric I have heard in the last few weeks is completely beyond belief. The good news is that these types of statements have created topics for debate in many places.
I should admit that the coming in of UTM has made the campaign towards 2019 more exciting. If this campaign was devoid of the UTM’s political choreography, the dance towards May 2019 would have been boring.

After the one-million-jobs-in-six months declaration, Saulos Chilima has created another buzz on the Malawi political front by promising to allow people in Nkhotakota to grow industrial hemp. While I had difficulties in understanding how UTM was going to create a million jobs which I think is not viable after listening to his explanation on how this will happen, I must admit that I am rather attracted to the chamba alternative.
It is, perhaps, important to look back to recent history of Malawi’s flirtatious relationship with chamba. The last time I heard was that Malawi was experimenting with industrial hemp. Malawi’s search for chamba as an alternative to tobacco has been boosted by efforts of people like Ntchisi North Member of Parliament, Boniface Kadzamira, who spoke in Parliament of his unwavering support for the legalisation of the sale of chamba on the basis that it is a viable alternative to boosting the country’s foreign exchange earnings.
Perhaps what is important would also be to understand that the Malawi Government approved that trials for industrial hemp should be conducted in other environments following the successful industrial hemp trials at Chitedze Research Station in Lilongwe.

These trials established that there are varieties available that have lower levels of the psychoactive substance, THC, compared to the limit set by the international community. Early this year, some sources estimated that Malawi has already invested about $10 million in the cultivation of industrial hemp, which is considered to have economic, medical, nutritional and agricultural value.
In fact, there is a British entrepreneur who was the first person in Malawi to be granted authorisation by the government to conduct trials on industrial hemp. Industrial has a great potential to replace tobacco as the new cash crop in Malawi and to see Malawians benefitting from its products at both a health and economic level.
Like any industry, the economics surrounding hemp play an important role in determining the future market shares that any hemp derived products might have. This includes the local economics for the farmers and farming communities and the international export-import trading markets. The global market for chamba consists of more than 25,000 products in nine submarkets: agriculture, textiles, recycling, automotive, furniture, food and beverages, paper, construction materials, and personal care. Hemp can be grown as a fibre, seed, or dual-purpose crop.
Hemp fibres are used in fabrics and textiles, yarns and spun fibres, paper, carpeting, home furnishings, construction and insulation materials, auto parts and composites. It can also be used in animal bedding, material inputs, papermaking and oil absorbents. Hemp seed and oilcake are used in a range of foods and beverages (e.g., salad and cooking oil and dairy alternatives) and can be an alternative food and feed protein source.
Oil from crushed hemp seed is used in soap, shampoo, lotions, bath gels, and cosmetics. Hemp is also being used in nutritional supplements and in medicinal and therapeutic products, including pharmaceuticals.
The monetary value from hemp could be massive. In 2016 alone, it was estimated that retail sales of chamba products was nearly $700 million which is equivalent to around K511 billion. In 2017, the United States imported hemp seeds and fibres to use as inputs into further manufacturing to the tune of $67.3 million equivalent to K50 billion. In 2018, there are approximately 30 countries in Europe, Asia, and North and South America that permit farmers to grow industrial hemp.
The list of issues is wide but, in our priorities, certain areas clearly demand greater focus. The current threat of the anti-smoking lobby to the tobacco industry demands far greater attention by the political parties. The country cannot continue to remain dependent on tobacco while the rest of the world is now legalising the cultivation and use of industrial hemp.

Malawi Revenue Authority confiscates 109 bags of chamba

The Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) on Sunday evening impounded a vehicle carrying 109 bags of cannabis sativa, popularly known as Chamba, each weighing about 30 kilogrammes at its Lirangwe customs roadblock in Blantyre.
MRA officials estimate the consignment to be worth billions.
Chamba is still illegal in the country and officials at the tax-collecting body have said the van registration ZA 1580 and owned by Chatherm Technologies was on its way to Blantyre from Nkhotakota.

Apparently, the van managed to cross all the roadblocks along the country’s main roads with the consignment.
But officials manning the Lirangwe road block, which checks any goods going in and out of Blantyre City, say they stopped and forced the driver and three other people out of the vehicle upon his reluctance to voluntarily allow the officers to search the vehicle.
They searched the van and noticed that all the 109 bags it was transporting were actually filled with the illegal herb.

The officials at the road block also stated that Police are yet to make any arrest on matter as the driver and the other three escaped as the police were searching the van.
So far Michael Mlenga of Nancholi Township in Blantyre has claimed ownership of the vehicle which is white in colour although its registration documents indicate it is red and is owned by a Mr. B Chawawa.
In an interview later, Deputy Director of Corporate Affairs at MRA, Steven Kapoloma, confirmed the development, saying police are really yet to make any arrests.
“Indeed as MRA we impounded a van which was transporting about 109 bags of chamba to Blantyre, this is part of our mandate as apart from collecting tax we also are under obligation to protect Malawian citizens from hazardous goods and products which may enter the country through our borders,” Kapoloma said.
Meanwhile, Kapoloma has also said MRA has officially handed over the Indian hemp to the police to help with investigations and disposal.
“Our role as MRA ended when we handed over the consignment to the Police to investigate and dispose of the consignment, but still more we will follow through the whole process,” He said.

Chamba convict
The convict with his two bags of Chamba
The soldier Noel Kabango (35), working at the Support Battalion and the gang members were  arrested following a robbery at Chipiku shop in Nkhoma where over K3 million  was stolen last month when they were armed with a rifle from the MDF containing 19 rounds of ammunition.
The soldier and his three accomplices  Jafali Bashiri (20), Mixon Banda (36) and Lyton Magombo (25),  pleaded guilty to taking part in a robbery on August 26 this year and hacked shop manager.
Malawi soldiers have previously appealed for an increase in their salaries, said to be meagre.
But Principal resident magistrate Patrick Chirwa said a soldier and prison officer should have been the last people to engage in crimes considering that they were entrusted with the security of the country.
“Yet, here we have them at the forefront using the skills and training they were entrusted with to terrorise their own beneficiaries. It is a very upsetting situation. For these reasons, I do not think a non-custodial sentence could serve the purpose in sentencing them.
“It is better for them to nurse their remorse while serving a long custodial sentence than for them to be let loose within the shortest period of time when the potential of them regrouping for further crimes is still in sight.”
Chirwa said the offenders deserved more than the recommended 10 years imprisonment because they did not just brandish a dangerous weapon, but they used it to inflict three painful scars on a helpless victim.
Elsewhere
In Dowa, first grade magistrate court has convicted and sentenced Weluzani Singade (35- years) and Kwame Banda (21-years) to 30 and 20 months imprisonment with had labour (IHL) respectively without the option of fine,  for being found in possetion of Indian hemp.
The two convicts comited the offences on different days.
But they were all busted on a road block.
The first case was prosecuted by constable Regina  Kumwenda and the second case was prosecuted by sergeant Triza Kalonjele.
The two prosecutors told the court to give stiffer sentences to deter other would be offenders.
The fisrt grade magistrate Amulan Phiri agreed with the prosecutors for a stiff sentences.
He therefore sentenced them to 30 and 20 months repectively without the option of fine.

0  Driver Noel Banda may have thought he was pulling a fast escape when he crashed through a special road block set up by Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) and police officers near Madisi in Dowa at around 1am last Thursday.
But it took only a few minutes for him to realise that his game was almost over, as the officers jumped into their vehicle and gave chase to his Toyota Dyna van registration BLK 4690.

After a five-kilometre chase, the officers had cornered Banda to a stop. When Banda initially responded that he was carrying stationery from Mzuzu to Lilongwe, the officers expressed reservations even before they inspected the load locked away in the van.
That is how the officers found, and impounded, 68 bags of suspected Indian hemp (chamba). There was no stationery found.
MRA, which sets up such patrols based on intelligence information that illicit goods are transported in the wee hours of the night in certain ‘porous’ areas, handed over the suspected chamba to  Lilongwe Police Station on Monday morning.
Lilongwe Police Station spokesperson Kingsley Dandaula said samples of the haul will be sent to Chitedze Research Station for analysis before a charge can be pressed against Banda, who is being kept at the station’s cells.
Dandaula praised MRA for their innovative special patrols nationwide which he said are helping the Malawi Police Service (MPS) in clamping down on criminal activities.
MRA head of corporate affairs Steve Kapoloma yesterday saluted the police for helping his organisation to put a stop to the movement of illicit goods.
“Our special patrols, which also target border areas where Indian hemp and other drugs may be easily moved in or outside Malawi through uncharted routes, have proved very successful. This latest catch is proof that we need to work harder in securing our roads and our nation,” he said. n"

0In a quest to expand its revenue base, Malawi needs to take the bold step of growing industrial hemp, with a clear conscience, as such a new venture will not only ‘fire’ the economy but is also internationally acceptable, a prominent University of Malawi professor has said.
Professor Ben Kaluwa, a Chancellor College economics lecturer, stressed this week that Malawi stands to benefit much if it starts growing industrial hemp, a plant of the same species and look-a-like with the illegal chamba (marijuana), whose growing, possession and smoking is illegal in the country.
Industrial hemp, he notes, is not used for smoking and has many by-products and uses which are quite diverse, including high-value textiles and clothing, specialised concrete applications and medicines.
Kaluwa was lending his full weight behind a proposal by Ntchisi North parliamentarian Boniface Kadzamira in the House earlier this week—that Malawi should legalise the growing and usage of marijuana, to beef up the national economy.
Marijuana is grown in most parts of Malawi

Kadzamira’s speech, during his contribution to a report in Parliament on statutory corporations and commissions, stunned most of his fellow parliamentarians.
Stated Kadzamira: “An acre of hemp produces more paper than wood pulp or tree. Apart from paper, you can produce, from hemp, fibre, fabric, soap, lighting oil, incense, medicines, food oil and proteins for both humans and animals.
“Hemp seeds also contain all the essential amino acids necessary for health. These are some of the usages that can be derived from marijuana. And do you know that even the US Declaration of Independence was written on a hemp paper?”
Most parliamentarians laughed off Kadzamira’s apparent eccentric proposal.
But Kaluwa insists that those who are laughing off the proposal need a serious re-think.
“I do not know exactly how the issue was presented [in Parliament] and the terminology used. But I think a point is missed, and will always be missed—even by political leadership like presidents, Cabinet ministers and MPs—if the issue is intentionally misrepresented for sensationalisation,” he explains.
He said Malawi should grow the industrial hemp with a clear conscience.
The confiscated bags of cannabis sativa (chamba) at
Nkhotakota Police Station

Asked how many countries are already benefiting from the growing of industrial hemp, Kaluwa responded: “This question is a distractor which can prevent Malawians from thinking for ourselves. Suppose there was no other country doing it, why should we not even think of doing something that helps us? We are not the first to know about the uses of the product and, in fact, in the US the market was manipulated to outlaw hemp-related production by vested interests.”
He allayed fear that growing industrial hemp may seem like a government endorsement to the growing of the other illegal hemp associated with the habit-forming smoking which has proved destructive to most users.
“It does not have to be that way: the products are differentiated and not perfect substitutes in use,” Kaluwa added.
He dispelled concerns over security and the regulation of production, particularly since the two hemp products are very similar in looks.
Nation on Sunday was unable to get expert views from Bvumbwe Research Station—where police often send impounded traditional harmful chamba for certification—and Ministry of Health on Kadzamira’s proposal.

0Anjiru Fumulani leads the crowd in paying homage to Matafale during the memorial
The misty blend of dust and chamba smoke engulfed the air at Mankhokwe grounds in Chileka, Blantyre where scores of the city’s residents converged to celebrate the life and work of fallen reggae legend Evison Matafale.
The memorial show attracted several artists such as Annie Matumbi, Lambanie Dube formerly known as Limbani Banda, man of the moment Skeffa Chimoto, Njati Njedede and The Never-ending Jupiters Band.
Taking a glance across the vast masses, one could not help noticing the prevalent Rastafarian colours and scores of dreadlocked Rastas.
This probably accounts for the free-for-all sale and smoking of chamba on the sidelines of the performances.
However, this could not account for incidents of violence that were common at the event.
For instance, a girl aged between 14 and 16, was gang-raped by almost four men.
Is this what Matafale stood for?
“Matafale was a peace-loving man as you can tell from his music; he was a Rasta but his music was for all people that is why we do not restrict anyone from this gathering. Don’t be cheated by the colours and the dreadlocks, most of the people here are not necessarily Rastas,” explained Black Missionaries leader Anjiru Fumulani.
Prior to the performance of the Black Missionaries, Skeffa Chimoto justified his ‘reggae dancing machine’ title by giving an energetic performance of the hit songs Chinamuluma Chakuda and Dalitsani Okondedwa.
Anthony Makondetsa then further lit up the stage with a performance of Mbumba ya Abraham and Ndilibe Mlandu which saw the crowd singing along.
The Black Missionaries celebrated the talent that was nurtured by the very man whose life they were celebrating by giving a powerful performance of songs from their Kuimba franchise.
Their performance was spiced up by freestyles from Lambanie Dube and Annie Matumbi.
But it was the self-acclaimed Nyakwawa, Annie Matumbi’s ragga version of Yang’ana Nkhope that kept the audience demanding an encore.
The event was also graced by Minister of Culture and Tourism Moses Kunkuyu who noted that it is government’s duty to promote the arts as it helps promote culture.
“We need to give these artists the support they need while they are still alive. In other countries, events like these are big and government is proud to see the Black Missionaries organising an event of such magnitude,” said Kunkuyu.
He further added that government recognises the influence that Matafale had in the country through his music.
“Matafale was a courageous man who was never afraid of expressing himself; we all know the controversy around the cause of his death. So, we recognise the contribution he made to the Malawian music industry and to the nation at large,” said Kunkuyu.
On his part, Fumulani said they have been organising the event to celebrate the life and artistry of the band’s founder.
“We have been holding this event annually for a decade now and the event keeps on getting bigger every year,” he said."

According to Limbe Police Station officer-in-change Josiah Kanthiti, three people have since been arrested in connection with the 13 bags of chamba, which were packed in 90-kilogramme bags.

241 1 minute readAdvertisement
Third Grade Magistrate Stanford Majoni, and nine other court and police officers, yesterday pleaded not guilty to all charges levelled against them in relation to theft of 84 bags of cannabis sativa (Chamba) at the Ntcheu Magistrate’s Court.
The ten appeared before Chief Resident Magistrate Ruth Chinangwa at the Lilongwe Magistrate’s Court.
Apart from the Magistrate, other suspects are accounts assistants, security guards, court clerks and court marshals.

The courtroom, which was largely filled by relatives of the accused persons, silently followed the proceedings, as the ten took plea.
According to court records, all the suspects are answering charges of conspiracy. Nine of them are answering an extra charge of theft by public servant.
“Stanford Majoni, Andrew Phiri, Patrick Thomas, Stain Phiri, Ricky Nachiye, Fatsani Chilambula, Patrick Tembenu, Enerst Jamali, Chifundo Chitsulo and Amos Jobo on the 28th December or on or about 28 December, 2015 conspired together to steal 84 bags of Canabis sativa,” read the details of the first count.

According to the charge sheet, Jobo, who is a police officer, is not answering the second count.
“…on or about 28 December 2015 at Ntcheu Magistrate Court in the district of Ntcheu being person employed in the public service as magistrate, district court administrator, security guard, court clerk and court marshals, respectively, and having, by virtue of their employment, had under their control and custody 84 bags of cannabis sativa and were unable to produce the same or make due account thereof,” reads details of the second count.
After plea-taking, the accused persons immediately applied for bail which they were granted.
Among the conditions, the suspects are supposed to produce a surety each, with a bond of K10,000 (non-cash) and the suspects to pay a bond of K10,000 (cash).
They were also told not to leave Ntcheu without permission from Ntcheu Police.
Central Region Police Prosecutor, Levison Mangani, told the court that the State will parade seven witnesses. He, however, said the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) will take over the case once trial begins.
Lawyer Frank M’bwana is representing the accused persons.
The matter has been adjourned to January 18, 2015.

Malawi Police intercept chamba cake

242 Less than a minuteAdvertisement
Malawi Police at Kamuzu International Airport (KIA) in Lilongwe Thursday intercepted Cannabis sativa, locally known as chamba, in cake form, weighing 4 kilogrammes.
According to KIA Police Public Relations Officer (PRO) Sapulain Chitonde, the illegal drug was wrapped in carbon papers covered with pepper “to disguise the smell and beat security.”
“The parcel was posted from Zimbabwe by a Cleyton Hickey, 19, whose address is Oakland Road, Braeside, Harare and it was going to Richard Peterson, 89, of Woodheyes Road, London, using Zimbabwean Post Office on Kenyan Airways from Zimbabwe through Malawi to the UK,” said Chitonde.
Advertisement
He added that KIA Police have stepped up security at the airport especially when it comes to scrutinising every parcel that enters or leaves the airport, hence the interception of the illicit drug.
The KIA Police PRO said no arrest has been made so far because the parcel was sent from Zimbabwe.
“We will communicate with our colleagues in Zimbabwe so that they can trace the sender using the name and address that we have,” said Chitonde.

Illegal importation of dangerous drugs is contrary to section 11 as read with regulation 19 of the Dangerous Drugs Act.
KIA Police have in the past intercepted a number of illegal exports and imports which include the lucrative but banned game trophies popularly known as ivory and round wood.

The court heard that the convict, Alinuswe Simwera used to sit along Mawelere stream evry morning where he could sell twists of Chamba.
Rumphi Police prosecutor sergeant Jean Chirombo told the court that the suspect targeted students from Chankhomi community day secondary school who were his main buyers.
The prosecutor said members of the public tipped off the police that the suspect was trading in illicit drugs.
“They promptly rounded him up and arrested the suspect at his marketing base along Mawelewere stream which is close to Chankhomi CDSS,” he said.
During the material day, the police found the suspect with 25 twists and some loose Indian hemp.
When the suspect appeared before court he pleaded guilty to the charge of being in possession of Indian Hemp contrary to Regulation 4(a) as read with section 19 of dangerous Drugs Act.
Sergeant Jean Chirombo therefore prayed before court to pass s stiffer sentence as the suspect was posing threat to students and at the same time jeopardizing their education.
In passing sentence, First Grade Magistrate (FGM) Cuthbert Phiri concurred with the state in saying that the suspect was a menace to society by trading in illicit drugs.
He therefore meted out a stiffer punishment in order to deter the other would be offenders.
Alinuswe Simwera 24, comes from Chilipapa village in T/A Chikulamayembe in Rumphi district.

Police Prosecutor Sergeant Christopher Nyirongo told the court that the suspects Boniface Brasho 23, Gift Banda 37, George Biliwita 22, Memory Banda 23 and Mayeso Misomali 30 were found with over 700 kilograms of the illegal herb on 6th April, 2016 within Balaka town.
“The suspects were traveling in motor vehicles Toyota Noah registration number NU 5035 and a Toyota Corolla registration number KA 4516 from Nkhotakota heading Zomba, and were intercepted within Balaka Town after the Police erected an abrupt road block,” he said.
The suspects pleaded guilty to the offence of being found in possession of Indian hemp and upon submission of the facts by the state.
Nyirongo asked the court to consider giving the suspects a stiffer sentence considering that “the suspect are not first offenders” as they were also convicted by the Salima Magistrate Court on the similar charge.
He said this shows that they are not changing hence the need for a stiffer sentence.
In their mitigation, the suspects pleaded for forgiveness saying they were doing this because of poverty and that they have children to look after.
Passing judgment, First Grade Magistrate Felix Mandala said the suspects deserved stiffer sentences and then ordered Boniface Brasho and George Biriweti to pay a fine of K60, 000.00 each and in default serve a 6 months custodial sentence.
The Magistrate also ordered Gift Banda, Memory Banda and Mayeso Misomali to pay a fine of K30, 000.00 each and in default serve a 3 months custodial sentence.
Mandala said he has given them such a sentence so that it should be lesson to them and would be offenders. The court has also ordered that the cannabis sativa be destroyed.
All the suspects paid the fines.

0  Traditional Authority (T/A) Chamba of Machinga was on Tuesday elevated to senior chief at a ceremony that took place at Chikala Primary School.
Minister of Local Government and Rural Development Kondwani Nankhumwa presided over the ceremony.
He said government mainly elevates chiefs based on dedication to development work and promotion of stability in their respective areas.
Nankhumwa: Continue developing the area
nankhumwa
Nankhumwa said Chamba was elevated to a senior position due to his ability to mobilise his subjects to participate in development work.
The area has a vibrant community-based policing such that Chamba area has not registered any abduction and killings of people with albinism since the issue started in the district in 2015.
The minister called on the newly elevated chief to continue discharging his duties in line with government development agenda and in the interest of his subjects.
Senior Chief Kawinga called on fellow chiefs to embark on projects that will benefit their subjects.
Chamba was installed T/A in 2005 and his elevation is effective July this year.

Liquor in plastic bottles displayed for sale at one of the markets in Blantyre – Pic by Francis Mphweya
Her 23-year-old son started taking liquor at the age of 15 when he was in Form 2.
“I did not expect it until the time when my son started smelling of alcohol each time he came back home in the evenings. As a parent, I confronted him and did all I could to stop him but he could not change,” Landirani says.
Due to alcoholism, his performance at school gradually dwindled. No wonder he failed his Junior Certificate Examinations that year.
“I persuaded him to go back to school which he did at long last but did not stop his drinking habits which eventually led him to drop out of school when he reached Form 3.
“Today his life is dependent on alcohol such that he can’t do anything productive because he spends most of his time and money on alcohol. I feel bad as a parent because most of his friends are educated and earning a living,” Landirani laments.
Alcohol and substance abuse has become a major problem in Malawi. Many youths are drinking spirits and smoking marijuana which is forecasting a bad future for the country.
Malawi News Agency (Mana) observes that substances such as marijuana, locally known as chamba, are easily accessed by the youth.
Even spirits packaged in plastic bottles are still available on the markets despite government ban. They are sold at lower prices than the usual stuff which makes them affordable to the youth.
Saint John of God House of Hospitality Clinical Director, Michael Nyirenda says the mental health hospital in Mzuzu has recorded extreme cases of clients who abuse the substances.
He says about 7 to 8 percent of those who obtained services at the hospital’s out–patient department in 2016 had serious problems resulting from chamba smoking and alcohol abuse.
“We used to have people starting to abuse substances late in their adolescence. But now we receive children as young as 12 and 15 years; most of whom, are in secondary school. This should be a concern for the nation. It only shows how big the problem is on the ground,” Nyirenda says.
“In 2016, an average of 12 clients attended our Addiction Recovery Programme every month and this number only applies to only those on the rehabilitation programme which runs for four weeks each session,” he explains.
Nyirenda adds that the number of clients who come for the rehabilitation programme at the hospital increases every day with many others on a waiting list.
“Most of these clients are assisted at our out–patient department and psychosocial centre without being admitted to the hospital for rehabilitation. Some attend our addiction rehabilitation services that run for four weeks,” Nyirenda says.
A recent study report by a 2016 graduating student from Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR) Chimwemwe Ngoma indicates that over 50 percent of students at Bunda College are involved in drug abuse.
The situation does not only threaten the future of those indulging in the illicit substances but also the country’s image.
Nyirenda says people who abuse alcohol and substances may develop serious health problems like malnutrition, cardiac complications, kidney and liver failure.
“Other health conditions include hypertension and lung cancer; additionally, alcoholics may be susceptible to sexually transmitted infections (STIs),” he says.
In fact, Nyirenda warns that if alcohol and drug abuse is left unchecked, the next generation may end up being illiterate since most of them may drop out of school leading to a vicious cycle of poverty.
“Consequently, the nation may harbor more criminals and high prevalence of HIV and Aids plus other STIs which are directly linked to alcohol and substance abuse,” Nyirenda says.
A Global Drug Report of 2016 says 247 million people in the world used drugs in 2015. Out of them, 29 million suffered from drug use disorders and only one in six people is receiving treatment.
The report also says Africa trailed America in production and consumption of chamba. Precisely, Africa accounted for 14 percent of all illicit herb seizures.
Malawi Police Service Public Relations Officer James Kadadzera says police have seized a lot of chamba on roadblocks as well as in homes through tip offs from well wishers.
He says if not confiscated such chamba most often find its way to teenagers.
Drug Fight Malawi Executive Director Nelson Zakeyu says the increase in alcohol and drug abuse calls for players to collaborate and strategize on how the youths can be bailed out of the situation.
However, Zakeyu whose organization aims at reducing the harm from intake of the illicit substances claims the institution is failing to reach out to many youths due to inadequate funds.
“Financial problem in the control of drugs and substances is an issue because drug abuse is never mentioned in government development strategies such as the Malawi Growth Development Strategy.
This, as a result, limits development partners to come in with their support.
“Despite the challenges, Drug Fight Malawi is working tirelessly to mobilize resources that would help in reaching out to the youths with evidence–based information on the dangers of marijuana, alcohol and other habit–forming drugs,” he adds.
Again, there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel as Sustainable Development Goal 3 advocates for good health for all people and calls for prevention and treatment of substance and alcohol abuse cases.
It is against this backdrop, therefore, that the Drug Fight Malawi draws its inspiration. Policy makers in government will now start aligning various developmental strategies to the Sustainable Development Goals.
Indeed, in respect to the Sustainable Development Goal 3, Malawi Government recently launched the National Alcohol Policy whose primary objective is to ensure reduced consumption of alcohol through sound regulations.
On their part, the police say they have embarked on an outreach programme to teach and sensitize the youth on the dangers of alcohol abuse and chamba smoking.
“It is a known fact that most of the crimes that are alcohol and marijuana related involve teenagers and those in their early 20s.
“We have a special programme to help the youth not to be in conflict with the law because of alcohol and drug abuse,” Kadadzera says.
Senior Chief Kachindamoto of Dedza, popular for dissolving over 850 child marriages in her area, has since called for a ban on spirits production and selling in the country.
“I am always dismayed to see young people who drink spirits because it is affecting their health. Evidently, most of them now have deformed faces because of the spirits,” she bemoans.
The hard-line Ngoni chief, therefore, calls on government to punish companies that continue to produce such spirits saying they were killing the country’s future that lies in today’s youths.
So, true to Kachindamoto’s assertions, it is not the responsibility of government only but every Malawian to ensure that the country’s young generation is protected from the jaws of alcohol and habit-forming drugs.

135,135,https://www.nyasatimes.com/malawi-players-in-booze-spree-whore-hooking-and-chamba-smoking-scandal/,www.nyasatimes.com,chamba,"Malawi players in booze spree, whore-hooking and Chamba smoking scandalAugust 13, 2013 Nyasa Times 19 CommentsThe dropping of some of the national team players in the Flames squad against Rwanda has just open a can of worms with revelations confirming that the players were initially dropped following a gross misconduct while in Zambia for Cosafa Cup last month.
Meanwhile, Football Association of Malawi (FAM) president, Walter Nyamilandu and Sports Council executive secretary, George Jana have since confirmed the issue.
One of the players who was part of Cosafa entourage disclosed to Nyasa Times in detail of what happened when the Flames were in Zambia, revealing that some of the players were in involving in uncontrollable drinking spree as well as sneaking women in their hotels rooms and openly smoking marijuana.
Of all the professional players included in the Cosafa Cup squad, it has been noted, it was only James Sangala who maintained discipline and remained in his room all the time his colleagues were sneaking out for booze or hooking errands.
Flames players sneaked in hotel rooms with women for sex
“One night, some of our guys including Joseph Kamwendo, Chiukepo Msowoya, Frank Banda, Dagarous Chirambo among others went out boozing, upon return, four of them came along with women but were denied entry by the hotel’s reception.
“An argument erupted between the players and hotel’s guards who were refusing to allow the women to be sneaked into the rooms. Initially, the guards were concerned about the safety as they feared the women could be thieves. A fight nearly ensued when one of the players pushed a guard on the ground, who quickly pointed out his gun before coach, who had waked up following the noise, intervened,” revealed the player.
Following the incident, Coach Tom Saintfiet demanded that the concerned players should pay a fine of US$200 each and recommended to FAM for further punishment. But the players refused to pay the fine, which has forced FAM to deduct the fine from their game bonuses.
There are pictures of some of the incidents that happened at the team’s hotel rooms. Some of the players were smoking Chamba openly. And the some of the officials who were part of the trip are suspected to have been involved some of the scandals after two Zambian women were found in Flames bus.
“There were two Zambian women in the team bus on our way to the game against Angola. How they got in and who they were with we don’t know. But they were given two team jerseys; number 10 and 19. Nothing has been said or done about that, which leads to the suspicion that the officials know something”.
Saintfiet told the local media on Tuesday that meanwhile the matter concerning some of the players’ behaviour in Zambia has been taken up by FAM and Sports Council.
“Some players were involved in serious disciplinary issues, but we are treating it as a father and son issue. Suffice to say discipline is of paramount importance and we are not going to compromise on issues of discipline,” said Saintfeit.
And Nyamilandu described the players’ conduct as, embarrassing, shameful and unacceptable.
“Allowances were deducted from the players that were involved and we proceeded to write them warning letters,” said Nyamilandu.
Depleted Flames squad
Meanwhil,e the Flame will miss the services of key players when they face Rwanda on Wednesday after five players failed to travel to Kigali.
The Flames will be without captain Joseph Kamwendo, Platinum Stars midfielder Robert Ng’ambi, defender Foster Namwela and strikers Chiukepo Msowoya and Esau Kanyenda amidst allegations of players’ protest over the behaviour of coach Saintfiet.
The last time the two sides met Rwanda beat Malawi 2-0 at Cecafa 2012 tournament in Uganda.
Malawi are preparing for away game against Nigeria in the crucial World Cup qualifier on September 7.

0Police in Mulanje have arrested two men for being found in possession of Indian hemp, locally known as Chamba.
Mulanje police spokesperson Gresham Ngwira said the two, Boster Chawinga, 29 and Paul Batson, 42, were arrested Monday.
“A Toyota Corolla registration number KA 4516 was parked along the road at Lundu. Some officers on duty wanted to find out what was wrong with the vehicle but when the driver realised that the police were heading towards their direction, he drove off. Unfortunately the vehicle lost balance and hit a tree.”
According to Ngwira, when officers searched inside the vehicle they uncovered 45 black plastic bags containing Chamba.
They arrested the two passengers while the driver escaped.
Ngwira said the items will be taken to Bvumbwe Research Station for examination. The two will answer an offence of being found in possession of cannabis sativa contrary to Section 4 (a) of Dangerous Drugs Act.
Chawinga is from Misuku village in the area of Traditional Authority (T/A) Mwenemisuku in Chitipa while Batson hails from Ng’omba village in Mulanje district.
Meanwhile, Police in Dedza have also arrested two men for being found with fake currency amounting to K1 million ($1 370). The fake money was in Malawi Kwacha.
Dedza police station deputy spokesperson Cassim Manda identified the two as Themba Nyirenda 46 and Benard Nyirenda 41 both from Chiyona- Nyirenda Village in chief M’mbelwa’s in Mzimba.
Speaking in an interview on Wednesday, Manda said the two are suspected to have planned to dupe Malawians coming from South Africa by exchanging the forged notes with Malawian currency.
Meanwhile, the two have been charged with an offence of importing or purchasing forged currency."

0  Police in Ntchisi have arrested two brothers for allegedly cultivating and being found in possession of Indian hemp, commonly known as chamba, without a licence.
Ntchisi Police Station spokesperson Gladson M’bumpha identified the suspects as Esau Banda, 20, and Samuel Banda, 21, of Ching’amba Village in Traditional Authority Chilooko in the district.
Police officers with some of the uprooted chamba
He said the brothers were arrested on Friday at Ching’amba Village following a tip-off from well-wishers that the duo had cultivated Indian hemp in their dimba gardens.
He said Police Criminal Investigations Department (CID) officers went to the village where Esau was arrested and he led the team to the chamba garden.
“Having reached the garden, the officers uprooted the Indian hemp and arrested Samuel who arrived at the garden during the operation,” said M’bumpha.
Police also searched the houses of the suspects where they found two kilogrammes of loose Indian hemp wrapped in a sack, according to M’bumpha.
The suspects will appear court soon to answer charges of cultivating and being found in possession of Indian hemp."

0  Reggae outfit Black Missionaries have backed calls to legalise sale of chamba (Indian hemp or marijuana), saying those who are against the proposal lack adequate knowledge on the importance of the plant.
Last month, Ntchisi North Member of Parliament (MP) Boniface Kadzamira broke the silence on discussions about chamba, which were last debated in Parliament in 2000 when the then deputy minister of Agriculture Joe Manduwa championed the proposal.
A pregnant woman blows a blunt at Matafale Memorial
Kadzamira observed that the country would benefit in terms of foreign exchange earnings by legalising the herb.
He said: “Mr Speaker Sir, an acre of [Indian] hemp produces more paper than wood pulp or tree. Apart from paper, you can produce, from hemp, fibre, fabric, soap, lighting oil, medicines, food oil and proteins for both humans and animals.”
Ma Blacks weighed in on the debate during a fundraising show at Key Lounge in Mzuzu on Friday night.
It was at 00.45am, during their trademark ‘Ganja Time’ where some patrons openly smoke chamba, that the group’s bass guitarist Ras Peter Amidu took the microphone to give his input on the debate.
“As you know, the ganja issue was talked about in Parliament. I support that. Ganja is not a drug. Ganja is a plant,” he said.
He then recited a line from Peter Tosh’s Legalise It and added: “This is roots time; ganja time. Don’t drink and drive. If you are drunk let the one who has smoked ganja drive.”
He, however, advised those who do not smoke chamba not to start if government, in future, decides to legalise the ‘weed.’
In an interview later, band leader Anjiru Fumulani said the Chileka-based outfit is in support of legalising the sale of chamba.
Merchants openly selling chamba at the Matafale Memorial in Chileka, Blantyre last year
“Weed is an important plant. It has more than 10 uses too numerous to mention. But the important one is that it can be used to cure diseases such as asthma or cancer.
“So, those who argued for it in Parliament know these uses and that it would boost the economy of our country. Some people know this. But they choose not to face the reality,” said the soft spoken lead vocalist.
He said others mistakenly think that smoking chamba would be harmful to smokers.
“They don’t know that smoking weed gives intelligence. We are behind those who are advocating for the legalisation of the plant,” he said.
This could have been a perfect diversion from recent attacks on social media of the band’s perceived sub-standard four promotional songs off their Kuimba 10 album.
In Mzuzu, the air of expectation for the new songs was pregnant. The Key Lounge, now O’Seasons, was filled to capacity. Toza Matafale, Yanjanani Chumbu, Moda Fumulani and Fitzgelard Simfukwe curtain-raised the show.
By the time Anthony Makondetsa came on stage, the floor was already hot with the audience in a party mood, thanks to Moda’s earlier energetic performance.
Makondetsa lived up to his mantle as he never disappointed with his escalating performance.
When Makondetsa left the stage at 00.45am, Amidu called the hall to order for a ganja time break before Anjiru took over proceedings at 1.06am.
But the performances had to halt briefly for 10 minutes following a small technical hitch. That, however, did not dampen the mood for party.
With the help of Amidu on bass guitar, Takudziwani Chokani (lead guitar), Yanjanani Chumbu (vocals), Gift Thugo (keyboard), Chizondi Fumulani (keyboard) and Paul Chokani(drums), Anjiru dished almost 25 songs for over two hours.
But it was their new Tizingochedza that the audience kept on demanding for replays. To excite the audience that, possibly had the majority of Tumbuka-speaking people, Anjiru engaged them in the Northern Region’s dialect version of the song.
He left stage at 3.25am."

0  Nkhotakota Forestry Department on Saturday made a surprise raid in Dwambazi Forest Reserve where they destroyed Indian hemp and other crops planted by encroachers.
Similar attempts to drive out the encroaching communities, particularly from traditional authorities Kanyenda and Kafuzira, have proven futile as encroachers continue breaking new ground.
A forestry officer slashes chamba and beans
The operation, jointly conducted with armed game rangers from African Parks which is managing Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve under a 20 year-long concession in a public private partnership arrangement, saw hundreds of hectares of Indian hemp, commonly called chamba, being destroyed while other crops such as beans, soya beans and maize were also slashed down.
In an interview after the exercise, district forestry officer George Ziphophe said he is not happy with the rate at which the forest is fast being turned into a hotspot for chamba cultivation.
He said the forest is being targeted for cultivation because of its fertile soils.
“There are a number of factors that compel these people to encroach into the forest. One such factor is fertility. The soils are very rich in mineral salts, hence, they do cultivate without fertiliser.
“Additionally, the moisture content is good such that they do farm in summer. But we cannot condone such illegal practice to prevail. We will take them head on,” he said.
According to a 2009 Nkhotakota District Social Profile, the 36 600 hectare forest reserve, which was gazetted in 1996, had 145 encroaching households that occupied about 283 hectares.
Dwambazi Forest Reserve is one of the largest water catchment areas where rivers such as Dwambazi, Mkoma, Khuyu, Luluzi, and Chiphumbulu. n"

0  Driver of a van registration number ZA 1580 carrying 109 bags of cannabis sativa (Indian hemp) weighing 30 kilogrammes each managed to pass through all roadblocks from Nkhotakota to Lirangwe in Blantyre without law enforcers noticing.
If it were not for officials from the Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) at their Lirangwe roadblock, the van would have safely arrived in Blantyre to offload the prohibited drug.
The van with the hemp
However, MRA officers impounded the van after the driver reportedly resisted to open the back of the van for check-up.
According to an MRA official at the roadblock, the driver, identified as Rington Muli by police, tried to offer them a bribe so that they let him go.
“Upon noting that his plans could not work the driver escaped the scene,” said the official who did not want to be named.
MRA has since handed over the van together with the hemp to the Malawi Police Service (MPS).
Were police officers in all roadblocks from Nkhotakota to Blantyre sleeping? Southern region police spokesperson James Kadadzera said in an interview today that they were also failing to find answers on the same.
“Let me tell you that we are all puzzled and as I am talking now we have launched an investigation on the matter,” he said.
Kadadzera said police are yet to make arrests on the matter and investigations are ongoing.
Once arrested, Muli will appear in court to answer the charge of being found in possession of Indian hemp.

Ras Chikomeni Chirwa with supporters after collecting the nomination forms
Collection of the nomination forms started from January 3 and will continue up to February 8 2019 while submission of the forms will be from February 4 to 8.
Chikomeni collected the nomination forms from the chief elections officer at MEC head office.
“I am happy that I have collected my forms which mean the process for me to contest for presidency has started- Jah bless,” said the Rasta man.
Chikomeni, a Nyabinghi Elder, wants to run on an independent ticket but stressed that he would do a better job than the incumbent President Peter Mutharika.
He said on Wednesday that is elected he will among other things establish a Chamba Control Commission – similar to the Tobacco Control Commission – and promote Marijuana  farming for medicinal purposes.
Chikomeni said Indian Hemp (chamba) is a plant which has many economic benefits.
“The most expensive crop in Malawi is chamba [Hemp] and Malawi has high quality Indian hemp. I am surprised that government focuses on tobacco yet we do not benefit anything from tobacco farming,” said Chikomeni.
According to Chikomeni, Hemp is an attractive alternative because thousands of products can be made from it. Legalizing it in Malawi would allow the country not only to cultivate the crop but also to establish a range of new industries based on it—at least in theory.
He added that if Indian hemp was legalised in Malawi, many people would be able to start businesses and
Chikomeni would get backing from Rastafarians to push for their right to smoke Indian hemp or marijuana.
The Rastafarians argue that smoking the drug locally known as ‘chamba’ is part of their religious doctrine which must be respected and upheld.
Rastafarians are determined to do anything that can enhance their presence and recognition as they are often pushed to the fringes of Malawian society. Children from Rasta families are not allowed to attend government schools if they have dreadlocks, and the police regularly target adult Rastafarians.

0Police in the northern Malawi district Mzuzu have arrested a 35-year-old Anti- Corruption Bureau (ACB) investigation officer on suspicion that he was cultivating Indian hemp at his house.
Northern Region Police public relations officer, Norah Chimwala, identified the suspect as Kondwani Zulu of Kansilanga Village T/A Mzukuzuku in Mzimba.
Zulu works at ACBÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s regional office in Mzuzu.
Ã¢â‚¬Å“Police arrested the Anti-Corruption Bureau officer for cultivating cannabis sativa (indian hemp) at his house in Katoto. About eight plants were uprooted from the house. They were cultivated together with tomatoes,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Chimwala.
Chimwala said the suspect, who was arrested on Thursday, told police that he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know that the plants were Indian hemp.
Ã¢â‚¬Å“Police are urging members of the general public to know the type of flowers surrounding their houses because ignorance is no defence when it comes to law,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said.
The suspect has since been charged with the offence of cultivating cannabis sativa."

Ras Chikomeni: Presidential pretender
Chikomeni, a Nyabinghi Elder, wants to run on an independent ticket but stressed that he would do a better job than the incumbent.
In a video clip shared on social media, he said Malawi is facing various challenges because the country’s leaders are intellectually poor.
He accused the leadership of being inept and failing to solve the country’s challenges such as blackouts and unemployment.
“What our leaders think is buying ammunition, not giving people crops to plant and improve their financial situation,” he said.
He particularly derided the country’s politicians for not legalising the growing of Indian Hemp (chamba); a plant which he said has many economic benefits.
“The most expensive crop in Malawi is chamba [Hemp] and Malawi has high quality Indian hemp. I am surprised that government focuses on tobacco yet we do not benefit anything from tobacco farming,” said Chikomeni.
According to Chikomeni, Hemp is an attractive alternative because thousands of products can be made from it. Legalizing it in Malawi would allow the country not only to cultivate the crop but also to establish a range of new industries based on it—at least in theory.
He added that if Indian hemp was legalised in Malawi, many people would be able to start businesses and
Chikomeni would get backing from Rastafarians to push for their right to smoke Indian hemp or marijuana.
The Rastafarians argue that smoking the drug locally known as ‘chamba’ is part of their religious doctrine which must be respected and upheld.
Rastafarians are determined to do anything that can enhance their presence and recognition as they are often pushed to the fringes of Malawian society. Children from Rasta families are not allowed to attend government schools if they have dreadlocks, and the police regularly target adult Rastafarians.

149,149,https://mwnation.com/people-need-iec-on-industrial-hemp-legalisation/,mwnation.com,chamba,"People need IEC on industrial hemp legalisationby Michael Chimaliza 26/07/2015 in Columns 3 min read
0Recently, there has been, and there seems to continue to be heated debates on Indian hemp, commonly known as chamba. Almost every Malawian, including children, knows what chamba is all about. The reason is that chamba is associated with influencing bad behaviour arising from the mental effects of the chemical (Tetrahydro
cannabinoids) found in chamba on the brain. Of course, that is the sore reason those who indulge in chamba smoking want: a buzz due to effect of Tetrahydro-cannabinoids on the brain. I guess the problem is when it is oversmoked, common of drug abuse.
The other problem with chamba as a drug is that it is very addictive. There are many chamba smokers in Malawi, some of them holding high positions in respected organisations who are said to still be smoking chamba up to this time.
In environmental health, there is an area of study called Environmental Toxicology. Basically, this area of study involves understanding the negative effects of some naturally occurring chemicals, usually found in plants, on human health. These naturally occurring plant-based chemicals are scientifically known as xenobiotics. The study basically involves understanding the nature of the chemicals, how they enter the body and how they cause the effects, including calculating the doses above which effects can occur, otherwise known as allowable daily intakes (ADI).
In public health, this is very important because such pieces of information form concepts for Information, Education and Communication (IEC), which help people understand, in this case, the drug itself and its specifications, dangers of taking such drugs and limits of consumption if they are not to suffer from such effects.
Several people have joined the debate on legalising chamba, some for and some against, including Chancellor College students and professor  of economics Ben Kalua, and a certain musical band which is said to have proclaimed on stage the need for legalising, not only chamba growing, but even smoking.
This sentiment by the band and one radio phone-in programme on the same made my day and I laughed my lungs out. It clearly showed me how naïve and ignorant most Malawians are. We are a nation that jumps and comments on issues we don’t know, let alone, understand to look like we are clever. We are a people who do not want to recognise those that know and listen from them.
The fact of the matter is that the chamba which my good MPs and professor Kalua supported is not the same chamba that these fellas smoke. Nooo. They are completely different. Even if government was to legalise the growing and trade of this industrial (repeat) hemp, the band and the chamba revellers would not benefit because it is not the weed that they smoke during ganja time.
Facts of the matter are that industrial hemp contains only about 0.3 percent-1.5 percent THC (Tetrahydro cannabinoids, the intoxicating ingredients that make you high) while the marijuana they smoke contains about 5 percent – 10 percent or more of Tetrahydrocannabinoids. In order to get a buzz, one would need to smoke 10 or 12 industrial hemp cigarettes over a very short period of time.
I hope those who were supporting the legalisation of the growing of Indian hemp while salivating for marijuana now know that these are two different plant species.
It is pathetic that one radio station carried a full debate without even sharing these simple clarifications."

Chamba peddlers in with their bags containing the ‘golden leaf’
Chief Resident Magistrate, Thomson Ligowe jailed Jambo Jambo, 42, and his accomplice Boniface Chinthenga 40 years old after they pleaded not guilty to the charge of being found in possession of Cannabis Sativa contrary to Section 4 (a) of the Dangerous Drugs Regulations and 19 (1) of Dangerous Drugs Act.
Police prosecutor, Superintendent Moja Phiri told the court that the two were arrested by the police who mounted an adhoc roadblock at Green Corner along Chikwawa road in Blantyre.
Jambo was arrested on 23rd December, 2015 while his accomplice- who had escaped- was arrested a day later.
Phiri disclosed that 40 bags of Chamba were recovered from a lorry and a minibus the two were using to ferry the illegal substance.
The Indian hemp, the court was told, was firstly packed in the minibus driven by Chinthenga before being transferred to into the lorry driven by Jambo which had carried maize husks to be delivered in Nsanje district.
Chinthenga had managed to escape but was later on traced and arrested.
Magistrate Ligowe convicted the two after four witnesses testified against them including Doctor Moses Munthali, an analyst from Bvumbwe Research Station.
Jambo hails from Jambo village, T/A Mbenje in Nsanje while Chinthenga
comes from Ndalama village, T/A Chikowi in Zomba district.
Cultivating or selling of Indian hemp is illegal in Malawi though currently government is doing trials on industrial hemp as one of the strategies to boost the country’s ailing economy.

0Growing, using, or possessing marijuana is illegal in Malawi. But it appears both production and sales are rising.
The growth in sales means that growers cultivating the drug are motivated by large profits they gain from its sales.
A pregnant woman blows a blunt at Matafale Memorial
The production and selling of chamba has been increasing in the country over the years.
However, it is arguably premature to ascertain if efforts to curb its production are also on the increase.
In 2010 alone, the Malawi Police Service confiscated about 70 000 kilogrammes of the illicit drug.
According to the United Nations figures on number of chamba seizures in Malawi from 1995 to 2000 published in the 2003 Institute for Security Studies Report, 403 500 kilogrammes of cannabis was impounded.
The availability of ‘weed’ has reached an alarming rate in the country.
And this is evident in public spheres.
At almost every secular music show, revellers party with either chamba or smoke emanating from it.
Merchants openly selling chamba at the Matafale Memorial in Chileka, Blantyre last year
Men and women are publicly seen selling the product, even luring customers by capitalising on the perceived benefits of chamba.
All this happens in full view of police officers, who are there to ensure security at the shows. Yet, this hallucinogenic variant is banned in Malawi.
In 2000, the Rastafari
community in Malawi went to court to demand the right to smoke marijuana.
This subsequently resulted in government briefly exploring the possible legalisation of Indian hemp, despite police warnings of potential abuse by cannabis growers.
This was championed in Parliament by the then Deputy Minister of Agriculture Joe Manduwa, who argued that the plant could be a valuable alternative to tobacco.
The idea was supported by a number of MPs, but it never saw the light of day, meaning chamba remains illegal in Malawi.
Malawi Police Service press and public relations officer, Rhoda Manjolo, says the responsibility of providing security is for everyone in the country.
“People need to be proactive in terms of security and not wait for the police to always act. It is high time we start taking a collective measure. There are a lot of people who have been arrested for being found in possession of chamba, for instance.
“Talking about chamba smoking or selling at musical shows, there are a lot of people at such events as compared to the number of police officers, who are evidently busy with other equally important things,” she says.
Manjolo explains that sometimes the police miss out on certain things happening at the event.
“Again, police feel that arresting people at such places is disturbing the freedom and enjoyable environment for people,” she explains.
On their part, Musicians Union of Malawi (MUM) says police are to blame for the proliferation of chamba, even in townships where youths are openly puffing on the blunt.
“Some police personel do not go to musical shows to work, but to enjoy with the people; hence, they forget their number one responsibility: security. The police are to blame because they are mandated by law to control any kind of misbehaviour.
“As MUM, we have agreed that no one should be seen smoking chamba in public and check around, many musicians are respecting that. It’s the fans and the police that are misbehaving,” argues the union’s president Reverend Chimwemwe Mhango.
Clinical psychologist Chiwoza Bandawe contends the police are not assuming their key responsibility of enforcing law and order.
“People are motivated by profit and are attracted to where there are customers. A social event is attractive to such persons. Therefore; people take advantage of social events like musical gigs to do things like the sell or smoking of chamba.
“However, this demonstrates that the enforcement agencies are not actively enforcing the law. The society is also watching without approaching such people and asking to smoke elsewhere or to stop,” he states.
According to Bandawe, marijuana is a harmful substance whose main chemical ingredient is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is a fatty substance that remains in the body for up to three months after smoking.
It is associated with mental health problems in particular cannabis induced psychosis due to damage to the brain cells that THC causes.

Ma Blacks : Legalise Chamba in Malawi
The band through its front man Ajiru Fumulani threw its weight behind the legalization of the plant over the weekend when the Chileka based band held musical performances in the northern region.
While backing the Chamba trade, Fumulani said weed as the plant is popularly known is helpful in many ways including disease cure.
“Weed is an important plant. It has more than 10 uses too numerous to mention. But the important one is that is can be used to cure diseases such as asthma and cancer” Fumulani is quoted as saying in the local press.
Added Fumulani: “So those who argued for it in parliament know these uses and that it would boost the economy of our country. Some people know this but they choose not to face reality”.
According to the lead vocalist, smoking Chamba also gives intelligence hence the need to support the legalization of the plant.
“They [people against Chamba legalization] don’t know that smoking weed gives intelligence. We are behind those who are advocating for the legalization of the plant” said Fumulani.
A call to legalize Chamba was made by Ntchisi North Parliamentarian Boniface Kadzamira during Parliamentary deliberations last month.
This is after the former Deputy Minister of Agriculture Joe Mandiwa made a similar call in parliament 2000 but failed to materialize as it attracted little attention and backing.

By Imam Wali Contributor:
The Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) has urged Malawians to inculcate a savings culture by, among other things, participating in the trading of treasury bills.
RBM Chief Examiner (Consume r-Protection and Financial Literacy), Madalitso Chamba, said the central bank is advocating financial inclusion, hence calling on Malawians to develop interest in capital and money markets.

Chamba was speaking last week in Dedza on the sidelines of National Financial Literacy Programme Community Outreach Programme that attracted traditional leaders, councillors, and other stakeholders.
“Treasury Bills are available to any Malawian,” Chamba said.
She said only a few Malawians understand the concept, culminating in the majority not making the most of it.

Chamba then assured Malawians that government is committed to protecting and paying back money once it borrows.

One of the National IDs which have been issued
The accused a resident of Chilobwe in Blantyre, in mid March 2018 met some unsuspecting job seekers and promised them he had job offers for them.
He gave them a condition that he would only offer the job to only those who are citizens of Malawi.
Chamba sked at least eight people to bring their national identity cards before they could be considered for the job.
However, as the job offer which the suspect did not disclose was taking long, the owners of the National Identity Cards became suspicious of the whole process and demanded to be given back their IDs.
One of the victims Miss Catherine Makweka 33 of Gulumba village traditional authority (TA) Chikumbu in Mulanje who also stays in Chilobwe township observed that the gold chip on her national identity card had been tampered with. This was the same with seven (7) other identity cards belonging to different individuals.
Miss Catherine Makweka reported the matter to Chilobwe Police Unit.
Police arrested Chamba on Monday April 2 2018 and had been granted a court bail on April 6.
Appearing before her worship Dianna Mangwana the First Grade Magistrate at Blantyre Magistrates Court, Chamba who had earlier pleaded not guilty to a charge of Mutilating National Identity Cards contravening section 42 (c) (d) of the National Registration Act of 2010, reversed the decision and pleaded guilty.
The court then found him guilty upon his own plea of guilty and convicted him forthwith.
In her submissions, Police prosecutor Sub – Inspector Monica Motchamanja Saiti of Chilobwe Police Unit asked the court to impose a deterrent sentence to the accused saying his conduct was criminal in nature.
In mitigation, the accused pleaded with the court to exercise leniency when passing the sentence saying it was not his intention to destroy/mutilate the national identity cards.
Passing the sentence, First Grade Magistrate Dianna Mangwana said the court considered that the accused was a first offender and that he pleaded guilty to the charge.
Her worship Mangwana then sentenced the accused pay one hundred and twenty thousand kwacha(K120,000.00) fine in default six months imprisonment with hard labour.
The accused paid the fine.
Benjamin Chamba 30 hails from Kadulanya village T.A Kamenyagwaza in Dedza.

0The word ‘drug’ is not in common language of the country. I mean, in common everyday language because of late, this precious commodity has been missing in many of our hospitals and health centres.
When I was younger, one could not use the word ‘drug’ without being thought as talking about those illicit chemicals people eat, drink or smoke to calm your nerves or make your head spin.
One would normally think of cocaine, heroin and things like that when talking about drugs. Don’t ask me why, but I have heard it more than once that individuals found with marijuana or chamba have been arrested, tried and convicted for being in possession of a “narcotic” drug. Let me state that while the police refers to chamba as a narcotic, the pharmacist refers to chamba as a hallucinogen. The chemist swears by his god and is willing to be put in jail for life. But the chemist wonders why on earth we have called chamba a narcotic drug instead of a hallucinogen.
I have just been thinking that if I became president of this country, one thing I would surely do every day is the following: I would wake up as I normally do about 4:30 am. Take a bath, eat something and watch cartoons for some good 30 minutes. I am talking about cartoons such as Maya and Miguel, Dora or the various versions of Garfield. Thereafter, I would be ready for another 30 minutes meeting with a principal secretary.
I would make it a point that each day of the month, I had one PS meeting with me. After all, there are like over 20 ministries, which makes it possible that I could meet with one PS once a month. The reason is simple: the PSs are running government departments on my behalf. There is very little chance that I will make reasonable, sustainable and meaningful decisions without the advice and cooperation of the PS. Unless, of course, I made the mistake of getting a wrong PS in the first place.
There are offers from people from all around the world to help our health system in many things. People have come to train our health workers in ATLS (Advanced Trauma Life Support). Every health worker needs to know something, if not enough, on ATLS. But as a president, I would ask the Secretary for Health: Is this something we can do on our own or someone will have to fly from London to teach us this?
Further, our lack of drugs is a bad thing. But the world out there is willing to help. There will be containers coming to us soon loaded with drugs. Yes, people pity us and they don’t want us to die. But they also have confidence in the government of JB. So, when I hear that there are loads and loads of drugs, as President, I would, in my monthly meetings with the Secretary for Health ask: are there any World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines on drug (medicines) donations? Let me see them."

0  Police in Nkhotakota on Monday arrested a Malawi Defence Force (MDF) soldier for allegedly being found in possession of Indian hemp (chamba).
Nkhotakota Police Station spokesperson Williams Kaponda, in a statement made available to The Nation, identified the MDF soldier as Andrew Matochi, 34, based at Kamuzu Barracks in Lilongwe.

This is the first chamba (Cannabis sativa) interception at KIA in the year but more similar cases were reported at the airport between August and November in 2015.
During the period, police in Blantyre arrested a Nigerian known as Mzee Chidiebere on allegations that he was behind the posting of some such parcels from Blantyre to Europe via KIA.

0It took officers from the Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) to impound a truckload of 109 bags of Indian hemp (chamba) at Lirangwe roadblock in Blantyre north in January 2016.
The drugs—which presumably originated from Nkhotakota—were destined for Blantyre city and only the timely interception of the tax officers put a stop to a huge consignment that had eluded officers at a number of police checkpoints in between the two areas—which are almost 400km apart.
Police officers inspect the chamba that was intercepted at Lirangwe
Southern Region police spokesperson James Kadadzera expressed surprise at the efficiency with which the syndicate transporting the drug had managed to elude several police checkpoints until it was stopped by an unlikely agency.
Questions have been asked regarding the effectiveness of police roadblocks in the wake of high profile breaches where huge volumes of the illicit drug—which is mainly produced in Nkhotakota and Mzimba—has found  its way into the country’s major cities, causing both security and health concerns.
But amid questions over the law enforcers’ ability to nip drug trafficking in the bud, Malawi Police Service national spokesperson Nicholas Gondwa has backed police officers for their diligence and alertness, but he blamed the country’s road network as the chief cause for such lapses.
“We are doing everything in our powers to stop drug cartels from trafficking chamba into towns and cities. Unfortunately, our efforts are being hampered by the country’s road network. There are a lot of unchartered routes from Nkhotakota to Zalewa routes which these people use. Normally they get caught closer to Blantyre where their options are few and far between,” he said in a telephone interview on Monday.
Gondwa said police had information that drug peddlers branch off into earth roads before Sharpe Valley in Ntcheu and use roads that skirt the mountains all the way to Mtonda—beating three roadblocks at Sharpe Valley, Salima turn off and Chingeni.
He, however, insisted that the police are containing the situation through mounting ad hoc roadblocks on the country’s roads.
“People should know that those roadblocks are mounted based on intelligence. Currently, all police station management officers have been encouraged to use this method and it has been very effective in dealing with crime,” Gondwa said.
While acknowledging the strides the police are making in arresting chamba traffickers, executive director for Drug Fight Malawi, Nelson Zakeyu, blamed the opening of new markets for chamba.
“We appreciate that the police are doing their part under difficult circumstances. They do not have enough resources in terms of equipment and personnel.
“But we have seen an escalation of drug trafficking especially chamba of late. We believe the influx of foreign artists who drum up support for its legalisation is creating a bigger demand for hemp in the country.
“This is dangerous especially to people under the age of 21 who might have their brains permanently damaged when they take the drug,” he said.
Some stakeholders, such as ministries of Home Affairs, Health and Education and civil society organisations, have raised concerns over the escalation in the uptake of illicit drugs by young people in the country. The police have been held responsible for the failure to get things under control.
Martha Savala, a parent from Traditional Authority Khombedza’s area in Salima, said it is high time the government put up serious measures to deal with the chamba network.
“It is always mind-boggling that the police always want to arrest the situation at the end of the distribution chain. No wonder they are failing to control the trafficking of chamba. In fact they should have addressed the problem from the source by blocking production. They [police] know exactly where chamba is produced, how come they do not arrest the growers?” she queried.
While Gondwa blamed the country’s road network for the proliferation of chamba traffickers escaping the police dragnet CaananNyirenda, a transporter based in Mzuzu, said the law enforcers should find another excuse.
“It is not easy for chamba traffickers to use side routes to escape from drug enforcement agencies as it is being claimed. One only has to look at the country’s state of roads to realise that it is quite a tall order for those that transport chamba to divert to unchartered routes. The police needs to tighten the screws within its establishment to ensure corruption among officers manning roadblocks is eliminated,” said Nyirenda.
According to Maziko Matemba, executive director at Health Rights and Education Programme, the question of infiltration in the police rank and file should be a priority area the law enforcers have to work on.
“The health challenges that chamba causes are so enormous and they eat up a portion of the country’s health budget. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the government to stop being defensive and start addressing the problem by increasing drug enforcement efforts. They do not have to leave this job to police alone, different agencies such as the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) should also be roped in,” he said.
But commenting on why there is a veil of secrecy when disposing off of large consignments of chamba which has already been used as evidence by the courts, Gondwa said the laws of the country are used to determine how this should be done.
“Whenever the courts have used the drug as evidence they release it to be destroyed and the police, Judiciary and the Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services all witness this exercise. That is what the law demands. Nowadays, whenever possible, we invite the media to be part of the team but that is not mandatory. All the hemp is destroyed when released by the courts,” he said.

According to widely circulated documents to the media  by MSB Employees, Bonongwe is accused of favouring staff from his district of origin Ntcheu at the expense of well qualified and deserving personnel.
Bonongwe, according to concerned employees, upon his appointment, he made sure that the old board is replaced by people he would easily manipulate. The current board is chaired by  former Reserve Bank Governor Victor Mbewe his homeboy from Ntcheu.
The documents reveal Ms Alice Konyani, a director who also comes from Ntcheu  chairs the Human Resources and Appointments subcommittee of the board.
Bonongwe: Nepotism claims
Given this structure of the wholly-owned government firm, Bonongwe was able to ensure that he signed a 5 year contract instead of the normal 3 year contract.
Since his arrival, he has made sure that most of the key appointments and promotions go to his kinsmen from Ntcheu at the expense of more deserving personnel existing in the bank. The following are a few examples:
Francis Kammnalere, Head Corporate Banking
Gertrude Chimbeya, Branch Manager, Limbe
Brenda Chilima, Corporate Affairs Managers
Frazer Azere, Branch Manager Chikhwawa
Preston Kefa, Branch Manager, Lunzu (Direct Nephew)
The CEO has reportedly released an Administrative Notice NO152 announcing Senior Management Changes and promotions whereby major beneficiaries are from his home district of Ntcheu.
Fanuel Kumdana, to head a new department known as Admin and Support Services
Million Hera promoted to head Treasury &amp; International Trade
Francis Kammalere, Head of Operations (all branch managers and outlets to report to him).
Brenda Chilima to head Business Development and Marketing
A number of senior members of staff who were key in decision making process before his return are either being sidelined or ignored in one way or the other, the staff claimed. These include the former acting CEO now DCEO, Kayisi Sadala, Head of Fiance James Salaka, Head of Human Resources and former Company Secretary Haston Chamba.
Some people have either been relocated or transferred to junior jobs such as;
Haston Chamba who was hitherto the bank’s Head of HR and Admin/Company Secretary is now just Head of HR
Fearless Malulu who was Head of Internal Audit was moved to head as small department of Risk &amp; Compliance
Abel Gondwe was moved as Branch Manager Mzuzu to a lower job in Head Office.
Levi Chirwa was moved as Branch Manager Capital City to a lower job at Head Office.
Jacob Ackim was moved as Branch Manager Capital City to manage a smaller Agriculture section. He had earlier replaced Mr. Chirwa at Capital City but moved within few months without a reason.
Meanwhile, Bonongwe has created a new inner circle that is now responsible for most of the decisions taking place in the bank. This is composed of Temwa Munthali – dubbed as ‘chief gossiper and spy’ -, Francis Kammalere and Fanuel Kumdana.
The workers said renewal of contracts for a number of members of Senior Management are being withheld for no reason at all, citing contracts for the Head of Fiance (James Sakala), Head of ICT (Sam Phiri) and Head of Retail and Business Banking (Teddie Chanza) expired last July but they have not being renewed thereby leaving them in suspense as to their career prospects and future.
These people are being perceived to have been closer to their previous management.
The CEO had directed that all construction projects in the company should be coordinated by Kamwaza Design owned by his close friend and home boy Daniel Kamwaza. MSB staff accuse Kamwaza that his charges are too exorbitant further draining the company’s resources.
Nyasa Times solicited comment from Bonongwe but could not get reply and the company marketing manager was also coy to respond.
Bonongwe was once CEO for MBS before he was replaced by Joseph Mwanamvekha in 2004.

161,161,https://mwnation.com/rbm-for-increased-financial-literacy/,mwnation.com,chamba,"RBM for increased financial literacyby Johnny Kasalika 01/06/2012 in Business News 2 min read
0The Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) has vowed to scale up consumer awareness and consumer education activities in the country aimed at increasing financial literacy levels among Malawians.
The bankâ€™s principal examiner for consumer education and complaints handling unit Madalitso Chamba told business journalists in Lilongwe that the central bank is determined to help financial consumers understand their rights.
Financial literacy, according to RBM, means the understanding, knowledge, skills, values and attitudes that people have about financial institutions and the services and products that they offer.
“That is why we have established the consumer education and complaints handling unit which has been mandated to coordinate all financial consumer education and consumer protection activities,” said Chamba.
Analysts contend that financial literacy is an important tool for financial stability of a country and economic development.
Results of a survey conducted by the World Bank in 2008 revealed that less than 20 percent of Malawians have access to financial services and products.
It is generally argued that one of the factors causing such a limited access to financial services is lack of necessary financial information by consumers and the public.
Chamba explained that most Malawians, especially the less privileged, are not knowledgeable about financial services and products being offered by financial institutions such as insurers.
Financial literate consumers, according to Chamba, can make more informed decisions and demand higher quality services, which he said encourage competition and innovation in the financial market.
He, however, urged consumers to lodge complaints at the bankâ€™s consumer education and complaints handling unit which, he said, will assist in consumer protection and hold service providers accountable.
But he said examples of the nature of complaints that RBM has received and handled include loss of dividends and investment shares due to lack of procedural knowledge.
“There is an increasing wide range of financial products and services on the financial market. People with a higher level of financial literacy are in a better position to manage their money, participate in the stock market, perform better on their portfolio and they are more likely to choose investment managers or brokers with low fees.”
According to Chamba, research shows that higher levels of financial literacy are directly related, not only to asset building, but also to debt and debt management."
162,162,https://www.nyasatimes.com/hemps-legalisation-debate-gaining-ground-in-malawi/,www.nyasatimes.com,chamba,"Hemp’s legalisation debate gaining ground in MalawiMay 25, 2015 Nyasa Times Reporter 42 CommentsEconomists and activists have added a positive voice to the calls for the legalisation of Indian hemp, saying Malawi stands to benefit much if it starts growing industrial hemp.
Kadzamira: Commercial use of Chamba
Ntchisi North parliamentarian Boniface Kadzamira stood in Parliament last week—that Malawi should legalise the growing and usage of hemp, to beef up the national economy.
Kadzamira argues that Malawi stood to gain a great deal from cultivating the plant legally, a much-sought-after commodity on the world market.
The Malawi Health Equity Network (Mhen), the Drug Fight Malawi have called for proper research on the proposal while prominent University of Malawi professor of economist, Ben Kalua, argues that industrial hemp fibres are used to manufacture a wide-range of items like textiles, cosmetics, specialised concrete applications and medicines.
He said industrial hemp has enormous potential as an agricultural crop, saying people don’t understand the economic benefits of industrial hemp because of the confusion caused with the illicit drug – Chamba or Marijuana.
Economic professor Ben Kaluwa: There are benefits
Kalua, of Chancellor College in Zomba, said Malawi should grow the industrial hemp with a clear conscience.
“We are not the first to know about the uses of the product and, in fact, in the US the market was manipulated to outlaw hemp-related production by vested interests,” he said.
Mhen Executive Director Martha Kwataine has called for research on the issue on “whether the benefits will be more than the negatives.”
Kwataine also said although legalising Indian hemp can help to generate resources for the country, there is need to look into the cost of such a decision.
She said the hemp, which is cheap to grow, is a major contributor to people entering the country’s psychiatric hospitals.
“We may end up creating an environment where people are free to smoke Chamba and becoming mentally ill,” explained Kwataine.
Executive Director for Drug Fight Malawi Nelson Zakeyo called for evidence backed research, saying a lot of Malawians are abusing hemp as the cannabis drug.
But Kadzamira said he is promoting the non-narcotic herb.

Ngwenya: We should not only be known for making profits but also for our contribution in the secondary education sector.
Companies present during the dinner event included Press Trust which pledged K300 million, Globe Internet Limited which committed K24 million as well as Raiply Malawi which also pledged K20 million.
Speaking earlier, President Lazarus Chakwera said time has come for people to go beyond saying things and acting to show the results.
Chakwera then urged the private sector to wholeheartedly support secondary education, saying the gesture would bring the light side out of the darkness secondary school students were facing.
“If we make secondary school sector the best, then the product will also be the best,” said the country’s Head of State.
“We must learn to practice a discipline that will make others happy because by doing this, then we are actually doing ourselves a favour as we are building a greater nation,” he added.
Speaking on behalf of the private sector, Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry President, James Chimwaza said the sector has deep interest in education as it believes that vibrant education is vital to human capital.
Chimwaza, however, advised government to provide incentives such as tax wavers, for companies that will be part of the initiative.
“Government should also provide incentives to the private sector by reducing tax on some goods and services.
“This will go a long way in enhancing the companies’ corporate social responsibility. Otherwise, we are ready to be an active government partner in developing the country,” said Chimwaza.
Government intends to construct 34 high quality secondary centres of excellence in each education district that will be triple-streamed and compete with Kamuzu Academy, according to the Minister of Education, Agness Nyalonje.
She explained that the schools will cost K100 billion to construct and help the country to move away from the perception that having a library, science laboratory and qualified teachers is a luxury.
In a few years to come, Nyalonje said would love to see all secondary school learners, including those from Community Day Secondary Schools pursuing science-related courses as they will have the opportunity to use a laboratory during their secondary school days.
Bankers Association of Malawi (BAM) president, Kwanele Ngwenya concurred with Chimwaza, saying: “In decades to come, we should not only be known for making profits but also for our contribution in the secondary education sector.”

Chamba peddlers in with their bags containing the ‘golden leaf’
Central region police publicist Ramsy Mushani confirmed the arrest of six high powered justice administration Ncheu officials.
The arrest is an embarrassment and set back to the provision of justice in Ntcheu and the fight against indian hemp growing and trafficking.
Sources say the hemp – localy known as Chamba -was impounded early December at an adhoc road block at Bawi in Ntcheu.
One person was convicted and fined K170000 or in default 14 months IHL.
Nyasa Times source says the Chamba was then supposed to be burnt but when regional police officers came to destroy the hemp, they were told it was already burnt but the district officials failed to show where the burning took place and some people gave testimony that they were being offered for sale.

One of the National IDs which have been issues
The suspect,  Benjamin Chamba of Kadulanya village T.A Kamenyagwaza in Dedza district and a resident in the township, commited the offense in March this year.
According to police,  Chamba in March met some unsuspecting job seekers and promised to find jobs for them.
He gave them a condition that he will only offer the job to only those who are citizens of Malawi.
He asked at least eight people to bring their national identity cards before they could be considered for the job.
However, after some time, the victims became suspicious of the whole process and demanded to be given back their IDs.
Upon getting their IDs back, they noted that the gold chip on the cards were tampered with.
The matter was reported to Chilobwe Police Unit who arrested Chamba on Monday April 2,2018.
He appeared before the Blantyre Magistrates Court Wednesday last week before he was remanded to Chichiri Prison.
He is expected to be in court on Friday for bail ruling which he applied before her worship First Grade Magistrate Dianna Mangwana.
Chamba has been charged with Mutilating National Identity Cards contravening Section 42 (c) (d) of the National Registration Act of 2010.

0On July 26 2015, this column published an article trying to explain what is meant by ‘industrial hemp’. A very good scientific description was put forward on the specifics of industrial hemp, which onetime MP Joe Manduwa and one Ntchisi MP proposed for legalisation.
I have been in academia lecturing for close to 12 years and this has christened in me a desire to always educate whenever I see or feel people lacking knowledge and I feel that I have or can solicit that knowledge. That’s what I was trying to do in this article. To tell people that the chamba people smoke is not the one being proposed for legalisation. I mentioned names but I know that the editor had very good reasons for removing.
But what has saddened me is that one of the prominent chiefs also has the same wrong understanding of this issue. One of the local newspapers had a story in which a Paramount Chief in the Southern Region was fuming on people who bring foreign culture in this country, which to him included the suggestion by some MPs to legalise ‘industrial hemp’. If the whole Paramount Chief fails to understand this how can he inform his subordinates?
I have never repeated an article, but for this reason alone I think this has to be repeated. I am sure my editor will remove the name of the chief but for those in advocacy please we need Information, Education and Communication (IEC) to masses on legalising Industrial Hemp. Below is part of what I presented last time if you did not read this.
Several people have joined in debate on legalising chamba, some for and some against, including Chanco students and their professor Ben Kalua, and one reggae music group which is said to have proclaimed on stage the need for legalising, not only chamba growing but even smoking.
This sentiment by this music group and one radio phone-in debate made my day and I laughed my lungs out. It clearly showed me how naïve and ignorant most Malawians are. We are a nation that jumps and comments on issues we don’t know, let alone, understand to look like we are clever. We are a people who do not want to recognise those that know and listen from them.
The fact of the matter is that the chamba which my good MPs and the Chancellor College professor supported is not the same chamba that these fellas smoke. Nooo. They are completely different. Even if the government was to legalise the growing and trading of this ‘industrial’ (repeat) hemp, the reggae musicians and the chamba revellers would not benefit because it is not the weed that they smoke during ganja time.
Facts of the matter are that ‘industrial hemp’ contains only about 0.3 percent – 1.5 percent THC (Tetrahydrocannabinoids, the intoxicating ingredients that make you high) while the marijuana you smoke contains about 5 percent – 10 percent or more of Tetrahydrocannabinoids. In order to get a buzz, one would need to smoke 10 or 12 hemp cigarettes over a very short period of time of industrial hemp.
I hope those who were supporting the legalisation of the growing of Indian hemp while salivating for marijuana now know that these are two different plant species.
It is pathetic that one radio staion carried a full debate without even sharing these simple clarifications. I hope now you know. Madam Kwataine, Malawi Health Equity Network (Mhen) has a lot of work to do here. Osamangothamangira zokalipira boma zokha. The reggae music band, chamba revellers an now the Paramount Chief need more IEC on such issues. That’s part of advocacy."
169,169,https://mwnation.com/malawi-lawmaker-wants-hemp-legalised/,mwnation.com,hemp,"Malawi lawmaker wants hemp legalisedby Paida Mpaso 19/05/2015 in Editors Pick, Front Page, National News 2 min read
0Ntchisi North member of Parliament (MP) Boniface Kadzamira (Malawi Congress Party) yesterday stunned the National Assembly when he asked government to legalise the sale of chamba (Indian hemp or marijuana), saying it is a viable alternative to boost the country’s foreign exchange earnings.
In his reaction to the report of the Committee on Commissions, Statutory Authorities and State Enterprises on the activities of the committee tabled in Parliament, Kadzamira said Malawi stands to benefit more if Indian hemp was legalised.
“Mr Speaker Sir, an acre of [Indian] hemp produces more paper than wood pulp or tree. Apart from paper, you can produce, from hemp, fibre, fabric, soap, lighting oil, medicines, food oil and proteins for both humans and animals,” he said, attracting laughter from other MPs.
Marijuana is grown in most parts of Malawi

According to Kadzamira, some States in the United States of America (USA) have already started legalising use of the product.
This is the second time an MP has proposed legalisation of Indian hemp. In April 2000 then deputy minister of Agriculture Joe Manduwa also surprised MPs when he championed the same in Parliament.
According to Manduwa, Malawi stood to gain a great deal from cultivating the plant, which, he said, was a much-sought-after commodity on the world market.
“Indian hemp has other important uses that can earn this country a lot of foreign exchange, as happens in other countries that have already taken strides in this direction,” Manduwa was quoted as having said.
Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development Allan Chiyembekeza was not in Parliament yesterday when Kadzamira raised the issue.
However, when called for comment on the matter, he said government does not take opinions as policies.
Said Chiyembekeza: “I have no comment on this. What he [Kadzamira] said was his opinion and we do not take such [opinions] as policies, thank you.”
In USA, Colorado, Alaska and Washington States have made smoking, growing and owning small amounts of marijuana legal.
In Malawi, Indian hemp is illegal and those found cultivating, in possession or trading the same are arrested and prosecuted in courts of law.
Hardly a month passes without reports of bags and truckloads of impounded Indian hemp from traffickers some of whom use unchartered routes or public transport, in some cases.
Indian hemp has several uses, included in medicine where it has been used for easing pain and inducing sleep or for a soothing influence in nervous disorders, according to www.botanical.com.

170,170,https://www.nyasatimes.com/questions-industrial-hemp-malawi/,www.nyasatimes.com,hemp,"Questions about Industrial Hemp in MalawiJune 22, 2016 Gloria Masula & Chimwemwe Manyozo 3 CommentsOn 16th June 2016, Parliament resolved that government should legalise the growing and usage of industrial hemp, both at policy and legislative levels.
Indian hemp’s narcotic relative, also known to users as Malawi gold, is so popular
‘Industrial hemp must be recognized, appropriately, as an agricultural crop, for industrial purposes distinct from other cannabis varieties.’-Speaker of the National Assembly, Rt. Hon. Richard Msowoya
This news was received with excitement. Especially, within the community of those who trade and partake the green herb. They were Singing Marlon’s Ashley-Ganja Farmer. Until when they heard that industrial hemp is different from Marijuana. Marijuana makes you get high, but industrial hemp if smoked can only produce a massive headache. Industrial hemp does not make one high.
Experience from countries that have legalised the growing of industrial hemp shows that this did not affect the enforcement of marijuana laws. Of course, they have to deal with general misconception.
According to Forbes, Industrial Hemp is a renewable resource, which has been used  for various industrial applications including paper, textiles, and cordage. Industrial hemp has also been used in health foods, organic body care, clothing, construction materials, biofuels, plastic composites and more. It has been argued that more than 25,000 products can be made from hemp.
The multiple uses that industrial hemp can be put into presents a tremendous opportunity for countries like Malawi to invest in growing and use of industrial hemp. How Malawi industrial hemp will fare on the global market when it is competing with Canada, Britain, France, Germany and Spain, and other 20 more countries is a question that needs to be asked.
Industrial hemp is both the present and the future. With the evident effects of climate change and theories of planet boundaries, industrial hemp provides an alternative to address the effects of climate change. Industrial hemp reduces deforestation, lowers carbon emissions and air pollution, and enriches the soil. Fabrics made of hemp do not have any chemical residue and is, therefore, safer for consumers. Hemp products can be recycled, reused and are 100% biodegradable.
Hemp provides an alternative source of clean energy in fuel, paper and construction sectors.
It is clear that if properly harnessed; then industrial hemp might help improve the economy of Malawi. Who are the potential winners and losers in this industrial hemp adventure?
If we are to go by experience, one issue that has been contentious has been the monopoly of multinational corporations that have monopolised the seed market in Malawi. The companies have both the capacity and expertise to produce different seed varieties depending on market demand. This has naturally affected local breeding systems which also depends on the multinational seed companies to produce seeds. Eventually, the production and sales of seed varieties benefit foreign companies. What strategies then will be employed with the industrial hemp to ensure that local breeding systems are strengthened to keep the income in Malawi?
Who gets to grow industrial hemp and sets the buying and selling price of industrial hemp? Again, going by the Tobacco experience in Malawi, one issue has been the tendency of buyers setting prices that end up ripping farmers off. Every year, Tobacco farmers have ended up complaining about the same problem. If not properly managed, the misery might be transferred from Barley to industrial hemp.
The general perception is that industrial hemp is the answer to many economic problems in different countries. There is a likelihood that countries like Malawi, will allocate more resources to growing industrial hemp. Efforts that if not properly managed might end up creating a single crop mentality which has been a problem in Malawi. It is Barley now, and might be Industrial hemp tomorrow. There is nothing wrong with investing heavily in industrial hemp. However, there is also need to consider giving similar attention, to various cash crops that can be grown in Malawi, and have a ready global market.
Let us be careful with the choices we make now so as not to affect the future. Let us avoid putting all our eggs in one basket but rather focus on other things/crops that are equally important and valuable as others. We as a country have potential in industrial hemp, tobacco, tea and all other crops at the global market.

UK advises Malawi to consider hemp

As Malawi struggles to find alternatives to tobacco as the country’s main foreign exchange earner, British High Commissioner to Malawi Michael Nevin has asked the country to consider production of Indian hemp for commercial production.
In a write up made available to The Daily Times yesterday, Nevin says Malawian policy makers and the public should consider whether industrial hemp has the potential to be a Malawi growth crop.
He says, however, the hemp being suggested is not the illegal cannabis variety known in Malawi as “marijuana”, “chamba” or “Malawi gold” but an industrial variety which is potentially economically viable.

“The industrial variety of hemp cannot practically induce the effects seen in the other marijuana variety,” said Nevin.
He said Malawi’s focus should be on whether Malawi can make an economic success of the industrial type of hemp which came into existence thousands of years ago and was sought after for its strong fibres.
Nevin said before mechanisation, the British Navy relied on Hemp Bast fibre for its sails, ropes and uniforms.

Apart from clothing, the help is also a nutritious food ingredient and can be good for improving soil conditions. Its stems are used for making fibre building materials and it also has a carbon neutral material.
He estimates the hemp food global market to be US$300 million with projections putting it at US$1 billion by 2020.
“Wars were even waged over hemp as it was such an important commodity. With the emergence of cheaper synthetic materials and the use of fossil fuels, natural plant material like hemp became obsolete and it was gradually – and mistakenly – lumped in to the same category as its cousin, marijuana,” explains Nevin.
He says, however, that industrial hemp is now undergoing revival and that it is now being grown in the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe where 15,000 hectares were cultivated in 2014.
“In the UK, it is one of the main fibre crops grown and its production ties in with sustainable farming policies. It is used in the textiles, paper making and construction industries. And part of the bio composites are now being used in car frames. If you are driving a car, it probably has industrial hemp in it. You may even have a t-shirt, bag or health drink that contains hemp,” says Nevin.
He says licensing systems have been used to regulate its production to make sure that it is not confused with illegal cannabis.
“I hope outlining the UK experience helps the debate to move on to how Malawi could also explore the crop’s potential. The industrial and marijuana varieties are different, with only one offering a legitimate market for Malawi to exploit,” says Nevin.
As in the UK, Nevin says Malawi should help create conditions for those who want to grow industrial hemp as a potential lucrative crop, with light regulation as necessary.
“There are Malawi-based companies, such as Invegrow, that are interested in developing the crop to Malawi’s economic advantage. There may be other factors to consider now that the marijuana connection can be set aside. But a more objective approach could open the way for Malawi to join an estimated 36 other countries in becoming an industrial hemp producer,” suggests Nevin.
Minister of Agriculture Allan Chiyembekeza said government was aware of what hemp has and welcomes other views on the matter.
“Even the High Commissioner is welcome to come and discuss with us on this issue,” said Chiyembekeza.

Now legally represented by Alexius Kamangira of Nicholls & Brookes alongside Chikondi Chijozi, Ruth Kaima, and Luntha Chimbwete of Southern Africa Litigation Centre and the Centre for Human Rights, Education Advice and Assistance, the lawyers have discovered that John was wrongly charged as a 19-year-old and they will argue that he is 17 years old — thus he should have been accorded the protection of a child under the Child Care Protection and Justice Act.
Mussa’s case to be reviewed
The notice from the High Court records that On June, 15 2022, Mussa John “was allegedly found with 78 plastic bags (weighing about 134 kilograms) of Indian Hemp at his home and charged with being found in possession of Indian Hemp without a licence — contrary to Regulation 4(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Regulations, as read with Section 19(1) of the Dangerous Drugs Act”.
“The offence of possession of Indian Hemp without a license attracts a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. When the Applicant appeared before the Magistrate’s Court, he was unrepresented, and he pleaded guilty to the offence.”
On behalf of John, the lawyers will argue in the High Court that the 8-year conviction be quashed and set aside his sentence.
The lawyers will also argue that “the Magistrate Court erred in accepting his guilty plea in circumstances where it contradicted his caution statement which indicated that he was not in possession of the Indian Hemp”.
The lawyers “will also argue that his right to a fair trial was violated as he was not provided with a legal practitioner considering the seriousness of the offence that he was charged with”.
The notice observes that the lower court record indicates that John is 19 years old, but he will argue that he is 17 years old and “even though the issue of his actual age was not presented before the lower court, he will argue that the lower court should have invoked the provisions of section 138 of the Child Care Protection and Justice Act which allows for extension of application of the Act to young persons over the age of 18”.
“He will further argue that the charge sheet was defective and that the sentence imposed by the lower court is excessive considering his age and the sentencing trends for the offence.”
The review is in the wake of a decision made by acting Chief Resident Magistrate (South), Chisomo Msokera, who found not defective teenager, Mussa John’s 8-year custodial sentence but had advised for the review of the case.
Dated June 27, 2022 under the subject ‘Confirmation and Supervisory Review of Sentencing in Rep. v John (criminal case number 475 of 2022) and Rep. v Milhade and another criminal case number 567 of 2022’), Msokera took cognizance of the hot debate that ensued soon after John’s conviction.
The hot debate was awash on social media in comparison to the sentence meted on Herve Milhade, Castel Malawi’s managing director — who was also found that he was cultivating the same illegal hemp but was just fined.
“The social media is awash with debates on the propriety of an 8 years imprisonment sentence imposed on a 19-year-old convict on a charge of possession of cannabis sativa.
“There have been questions on whether the punishment meets the demands of distributive justice since retributive sentence appears, as some claimed, off tangent some of the sentencing trends by the magistracy where fines and not custodial sentences have generally imposed.
“One of such cited cases is Rep. v Milhade and another criminal case number 567 of 2022 where the convicts were sentenced to pay a fine of K1 million and in default to serve custodial sentence of 12 months on a charge of cultivating cannabis sativa.”
Msokera observed that the case of the teenager was heard in chambers of the Senior Resident Magistrate Court because there is no designated court room space at Limbe Magistrate Court but the chambers were used as open court.
“The charge is defective as it cites a wrong punishment provision and does not cite the statute book where the offence is provided for. Section 19(1)(a) and not section 16 of the Dangerous Drugs Act is the appropriate punishment provision; and the offence is created under the Dangerous Drugs Regulations.
“The Judgement on Sentence gives reasons as to why, not withstanding the dictates of Section 340 of the Criminal Procedures and Evidence Code, the convict deserves an outright custodial sentences.”
“Msokera also observed that “the Judgement on Sentence took into consideration the mitigating circumstances of the convict being a young person” and that “other than the irregular charge, this was a proper matter which should be forwarded to a superior court strictly for proceedings of review on confirmation under section 15 of the Criminal Procedures and Evidence Code”.
“Other than what I have specifically highlighted herein, the rest of the proceedings — as far as the court record is concerned — does not strike me as defective.
“In view of the cited irregularity and considering the perceive injustice of the sentence as it relates to Milhade and another, Msokera thus invokes section 26(1) of the Courts Act in asking for a “superior court to exercise its supervisory powers in addition to the review on confirmation proceedings over both matters”.
“It is my hope that the process of supervision and review on the confirmation by the High Court shall enrich our sentencing jurisprudence to aid the courts of magistrates in meting our appropriate sentences in cases of this nature.”

0Following successful trials of industrial hemp at Chitedze Research Station in Lilongwe, Invegrow Limited, a company that was established in 2013 designed to grow and process Industrial Hemp in the country, plans to start commercial growing of the crop this year.
The firm, which has been working with government to research the viability of hemp as a commercial crop, has started mobilising resources for its factory in Lilongwe.
Director at Invegrow Limited, Nebert Nyirenda said on Wednesday some factory equipment should be in the country next month.
“We are mobilising factory equipment base which might be ready by this May as the hemp nears maturity stage in June,” said Nyirenda.
He said the company has cultivated eight hectares (ha) of hemp which will be ready for harvest in June.
Nyirenda said while Industrial Hemp is like any other crop, the company has to meet legal aspects as industrial hemp is often associated with marijuana—which is an illegal crop to cultivate in the country.
“Industrial hemp has more economic opportunities as we will be extracting the oil for fibre from the seed and produce oil products and it is also edible,” said Nyirenda, who adds that last year, the company imported body wash, shampoo and face wash with hemp seed oil just to give Malawians a feel of the products from Industrial Hemp.
Department of Agriculture Research Services (Dars) chief scientist Laurent Pungulani said research results show that the crop is performing better in Thyolo (Bvumbwe Research Station) because of the cooler weather than Lilongwe’s Chitala Research Station which is hotter.
“However, as this is the first season for the two sites, it is too early to conclude. There is need for proper analysis and conclusion scientifically,” said Pungulani.
But Pungulani warned that although industrial hemp is viable, it will require proper regulations.
Industrial hemp is considered to have economic, medical and nutritional value and government believes that it will help in boosting the economy.
With dwindling earnings from cotton and tobacco sectors, the hemp is believed to offer an opportunity for the country to diversify and attract more foreign exchange.
Government decided to scale up the trials from Chitedze by conducting the study in other agro-economic zones like Vumbwe and Chitala Research Station in Salima. The trials started in 2015, after getting Parliament’s approval.
At Chitedze, 10 varieties from Europe, China and Australia, have been to assess if they have low levels of the psychoactive chemical agents found in marijuana."
174,174,https://www.nyasatimes.com/malawi-research-industrial-hemp-completed/,www.nyasatimes.com,hemp,"Malawi conducts research on industrial hemp: OK as rope, not as dopeJuly 24, 2016 Nyasa Times Reporter 2 CommentsMeanwhile, a scientist at Chitedze Research Station in Lilongwe has said the station has completed the second phase of testing industrial hemp.
Zakeyu (centre) against legal hemp
The scientist, Laurent Pungulani said preliminary results indicate that the hemp has just one percent of the substance that intoxicates people as opposed to marijuana which has over 10 per cent.
He said this means industrial hemp is not harmful to human and can be grown for commercial purposes for making different types of things from cosmetics to clothes to building materials and food for animals.
Following the results, Everglo Malawi has been registered as a company that will lead a crusade in the growing of the hemp.
However, Nelson Zakeyu of Drug Fight Malawi said this was a sad chapter for Malawi in the fight against drug abuse and asked the government to reverse it.
Parliament overwhelmingly approved the farming of industrial hemp.

‘Objectivity crucial on industrial hemp’

Experts, investors, government officials and policy makers will on Thursday, September 24, 2015 from 2pm converge at Tamarind Club with the British High Commission in Lilongwe to discuss what industrial hemp is and is not, economic potential of the crop, its uses and how it is commercially cultivated.
The meeting has been sponsored by the British High Commission Offices and is aimed at raising awareness on this largely unknown fibre crop which is in high demand in western markets yet it is simple to grow for an agro-based economy like Malawi.
In Malawi, “hemp” has traditionally be e n associated with the variety of cannabis known variously as marijuana, chamba or Malawi gold. However, as with other vegetation, there are many variants of hemp. The current debate in Malawi risks unnecessarily confusing the illegal variety with the different, and potentially economically viable, industrial hemp variety. The industrial variety of hemp cannot practically induce the effects seen in the other marijuana variety.

Some have suggested that it is like comparing non-alcoholic drinks with beer – both are drinks, but the ingredients and effects are different. That being clear, focus should instead be on whether Malawi can make an economic success of this crop.
Industrial hemp came into existence thousands of years ago, and was sought after for its strong fibres. Before mechanization, the British Navy relied on Hemp Bast fibre for its sails, ropes and uniforms. Wars were even waged over hemp, as it was such an important commodity. With the emergence of cheaper synthetic materials and the use of fossil fuels, natural plant material like hemp became obsolete and it was gradually – and mistakenly – lumped in to the same category as its cousin, marijuana.
However, industrial hemp is undergoing a bit of a revival.

Industrial hemp is grown in the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe, with 15,000 ha cultivated in 2014 according to the European Industrial Hemp Association. In the UK, it is one of the main fibre crops grown and its production ties in with sustainable farming policies.
It is used in the textiles, paper making and construction industries, and part of the bio composites are now being used in car frames. If you are driving a car it probably has industrial hemp in it. You may even have a t-shirt, bag or health drink that contains hemp.
According to the European Industrial Hemp Association (EIHA) the hemp food global market was at an estimated $300 million. At the current growth rate it will reach $1 billion by 2020.
Houses have been built in the UK and worldwide using the woody core in the stem of the industrial hemp plant. Around ten tonnes of dry matter are produced per hectare, enough to help build a medium sized family home. It is also a carbon neutral material.
Apart from its uses in building, for clothing, and even as a nutritious food, growing the industrial hemp variety can be good for improving soil conditions.

‘Indian hemp cultivation not rampant in Nkhotakota’

Malawi police in Dwangwa have said cultivation of Indian hemp in Nkhotakota is not as serious as people allege but the district is only used as a route for traffickers.
When asked to comment on the severity of Indian hemp cultivation in the Central Region district, Nkhunga Police Station spokesperson Austin Kaunda said Mzimba is the main producer and supplier of Indian hemp not Nkhotakota.
“We have records that many traffickers are not from Nkhotakota but from other districts like Blantyre, Lilongwe, Mangochi, Balaka and Salima who pass through from Mzimba where they buy the hemp.

“So, what I can say is that the problem is serious in terms of trafficking because Nkhotakota is used as a route,” he said.
Kaunda also said this year alone police have confiscated 5,238 kilogrammes of Indian hemp following the arrests of 13 traffickers.
The figure is much higher compared to 509 kilogrammes of marijuana police confiscated the whole of last year after arresting 24 people.

The police publicist commended the good working relationship between police and the public.
“We arrest traffickers because of tips from members of the general public and we ask them to continue giving us information,” Kaunda said.
He further said police are aware that small numbers of people are still cultivating the illicit drug in Nkhotakota’s northern part along Lupachi River which borders Mzimba.
“We have had operations to uproot hemp in the past. In 2011 we carried out a joint operation with fellow officers from headquarters where we uprooted about four acres of Indian hemp along Lupachi River. Plans are there to carry out another operation but we are failing due to financial constraints,” said Kaunda.
Soaring number of cases of people caught trafficking Indian hemp from Nkhotakota prompted people to conclude that the district is the country’s largest grower of Indian hemp.

Hastings Phiri was arrested Sunday in Luwinga, Mzuzu’s industrial location, after residents reported him the police.
Indian hemp’s narcotic relative, also known to users as Malawi gold, is so popular
Northern region police deputy publicist, Maurice Chapola, told Nyasa Times that, apparently, Phiri had been engaged in the trade for “some time.”
“We were tipped that the man was cultivating and selling chamba within Luwinga, and our team went there and found out that it was true,” said Chapola.
At the scene of Phiri’s arrest police also confiscated Indian hemp that was “well-packed in plastic bags.”
According to Chapola, Phiri hails from the area of Traditional Authority (T/A) Msakambewa in Dowa district.
The suspect will be charged with the offence of cultivating Indian hemp under the Dangerous Drugs Act.

MRA spokesperson, Steve Kapoloma has confirmed the incident which happened in Blantyre where the MRA officials managed to intercept 146 bags of Indian Hemp following a speed chase of a 5-tonne Isuzu lorry.
Kapoloma said the lorry, belonging to Frederick John Chiuja from Mangochi, had passed through the MRA roadblock at Lirangwe without stopping for inspection.
He said this raised suspicion and prompted a speed chase of the lorry by MRA officers who were accompanied by Police Officers.
“The lorry then turned into a dirt road towards Machinjiri and our officers and the Police continued the chase.
“The Police then fired into the air and that is when they abandoned the lorry,” he said.
Kapoloma said the team called for assistance and upon inspection of the lorry, they found 146 bags of Indian Hemp.
He said the Authority has handed over the Indian Hemp to South Lunzu Police Station who have since delivered the illicit drug to Ndirande Police Station.
“This is not the first time for MRA to intercept Indian Hemp.
“Apart from collecting revenue, it is also our mandate to protect Malawians from the importation of prohibited goods which pose a health risk,” Kapoloma said.
He said the state will prosecute the perpetrators.

By Kondwani Munthali and Feston Malekezo:
Development of chamba (Industrial Hemp) regulations that will enable Malawi to formally join the growing nations is set to start this December as it awaits Cabinet approval, the Malawi Investment and Trade Centre (MITC) has disclosed.
MITC Director of Investment Promotion, Joshua Nthankomwa, told Malawi UK Business Group reception in London, that cabinet is yet to approve the regulations.

“The Special Crops Act is already in place, what we need now are regulations to govern the growing with Industrial Hemp licensing to start as soon as Government gives necessary approvals to regulations,” said Nthakhomwa.
The marijuana market is very lucrative compared to tobacco, which has been Malawi’s main forex earner for decades.
According to the Grand View Research, the global legal marijuana market size was valued at $9.3 billion in 2016, and this figure likely to go up $146.4 billion by end of 2025 when more countries decide to legalise the product.

Nthakomwa said, controls will extend to include local processing of the plants as no raw hemp or cannabis will be exported to ensure that Malawi gains maximum benefits from the growing of the crop.
“We have registered huge interests from companies in Canada, Israel and many other places. We look forward to many more investors coming, not only in this sector, but many other sectors that Government has created environment for one to grow their business,” he said.
InveGrow, a private company has been conducting trials on Industrial Hemp at Chitedze Research Station and the results were submitted pending further approval and proper framework for licenses to be issued.
“There will be controls on who and how can one grow Industrial Hemp, basically through green houses,” said Nthakomwa, who presented the two as existing investment opportunities in Malawi.
Internet search indicates an acre with 25000 plants can fetch up to US$60,000 in the USA in states where hemp has been legalised, indicating massive potential for a high yield crop that would surpass most of current commercial crops and minerals.
Two weeks ago, Vice President Saulos Chilima became the first high ranking politician to openly discuss monetising industrial hemp in Malawi.

“We are very thankful because it shows that there is cooperation between the general public and Mangochi Police Station,” Maida said, adding that it was pleasing that the police and the public share information leading to arrests of suspects.
Makweche confessed before the police that he has been dealing in the Cannabis sativa cultivation and selling for seven years.
He admitted that he grows some on his own while some supplies come from Ntaja and Balaka.
Makweche is expected to appear before the court soon after all paperwork for his case is done, according to Maida.

Why me? Chamba farmer in his garden
Senior Superintendent Charles Mpezeni of Rumphi Police Station said police were tipped-off that the suspect was cultivating Indian hemp in his garden, which prompted police investigation.
“We received a tip from well-wishers that someone was cultivating Indian hemp and we organised an operation which led to the arrest of the suspect and the uprooting of 405 plants of cannabis in his garden. The suspect planted Indian hemp on an anthill which was in the middle of his maize field. This is where the plants of cannabis were uprooted,” said Mpezeni.
The police officer said Mfune was arrested on the spot and charged with cultivating Indian hemp contrary to the Dangerous Drugs Act.
“The suspect is in police custody and has been charged with the offence of cultivating Indian hemp, contrary to Regulation 7 of the Dangerous Drugs Act,” he said.
Mfune comes from Chipereka Village in the area of Traditional Authority Chikulamayembe in the district.

“Police officers on duty stopped Ulemu Bus registration number BU 4875 travelling to Blantyre. Upon conducting a routine search, they came across a backpack and two suitcases full of Indian hemp. The discovery of the owners of the bags was made following a tip from a well wisher,” said Dandaula.
Dandaula said it is important for the public to be informing the police on criminal activities so that the police may act on the same.
“It is vital to tip police officers on suspicious activities. In this case, if the suspects were not arrested, the hemp would have reached the market and be sold to a lot of people including minors,” explained Dandaula.
The hemp has been sent to Chitedze Research Station for examination. Currently, the two suspects are in custody waiting for trial.

According to Central Region Police Public Relations Officer (PRO), Nolliettie Chimala, Police received the information from members of the community that the suspect cultivates Indian hemp in his farm found along the stream of Kamanthongo which is between Areas 10 and 43 in the city.
She added that the suspect mixed the plant with maize, cassava, onions, beans, green pepper and assorted vegetables in order to trick the public.
“Upon following the report we received from the members of the community, Police rushed to the scene and managed uproot the plant and arrest the suspect,” the PRO said.
Chihana urged the public to continue providing them with such kind of information about people who may be seen possessing, cultivating and selling the substance because criminals always live in our communities.
The suspect is pending court proceedings to answer charges of illegal cultivation of Indian hemp which Contravenes Regulation 6A as read with 19 of Dangerous Drug Act.

Zakeyu (centre) against legal hemp
Drug Fight Malawi official Nelson Zakeyu feared the research was a step ahead of legalising hemp which he said would grossly be abused by the youth.
“This is a setback in the fight against drug abuse. Not many can know the difference between industrial hemp and hemp,” said Zakeyu.
He then asked the government to withdraw the permits for the research and declare that  hemp is still illegal in Malawi.
The government announced two months ago that it would legalise industrial hemp, the use of hemp in products.
Those who are for industrial hemp argue that the government is moving in a right direction as countries that have embraced industrial hemp have had their economies turned for the better.
Some countries, including a few in the US have legalised marijuana smoking and the drug is sold in designated shops.
However the United Nations maintain hemp smoking is illegal and is blamed for rising mental problems in some countries and rising crime in others.

Ma Blacks
The grouping engaged the Malawian reggae outfit Black Missionaries that performed during the event dubbed as “Legalisation of Industrial Hemp Festival.”
“This is the first event that we have engaged the public face-to-face to explain to them what Industrial Hemp is all about.
“It is encouraging to note that many people are eager to learn and know more about this cash crop,” said chairperson of the forum Sangwani Msofi.
He further said that most of the activities the forum has conducted have been panel discussions and interviews in the media and academic discussions which are largely indoors and engages only privileged members of society.
“The festival in Lilongwe was the first open-air activity that we engaged with all classes of people. We were impressed with the curiosity many had that was generated upon seeing displayed products from industrial Hemp.
“Many were eager to learn more about the cash crop,” Msofi said.
The Kemet chair said the festival has aroused a great drive to conduct more of these activities to reach out to as many people as they can in clearing out the misconceptions surrounding Industrial Hemp.
The Sunday Festival was graced by activist Billy Banda and Member of Parliament for Ntchisi North Boniface Kadzamira who raised the matter in parliament earlier this year. The legislator argues Industrial Hemp as a cash crop has enormous economic potential.
Kemet Forum, whose name means land of the blacks and was the original name for Egypt, has been carrying out activities related to the call for the legalisation of Industrial Hemp.
In July this year, the forum held a seminar at Chancellor College in Zomba under the theme “Demystifying Cannabis.”
Professor of Economics at Chancellor College Ben Kalua made a presentation in which he called for the de-politicisation of the production of Cannabis-locally known as Chamba- arguing industrial hemp has the potential to steer the country’s economy towards recovery.

Renewed calls for hemp cultivation

By Rebecca Chimjeka:
Foreign nationals have started visiting the country on fact-finding missions related to the cultivation of Indian hemp for industrial purposes.
In 2015, President Peter Mutharika gave Invegrow Hemp Power Malawi the nod to embark on industrial hemp cultivation on trial basis.

And, on the international scene, the government of Canada recently legalised the cultivation of Indian hemp for medical use.
Speaking after meeting a group of foreign nationals that is interested in investing in the country, Ntchisi North Member of Parliament (MP), Boniface Kadzamira, asked the government to consider legalising cultivation of all types of hemp in the country.
Kadzamira said investors are ready to invest in 50,000 thousand hectares of both industrial and some hemp verities that are cultivated for medical purposes.

“The country has all it can to grow hemp for both medical and industrial purposes. The government should emulate what some African countries are doing by putting some guidelines on the cultivation of such types of hemp,” Kadzamira said.
The call comes four years after the MP moved a motion in Parliament that would pave the way for cultivation of industrial hemp for trial purposes.
Graham Mackintosh, spokesperson for Green Quest Farmarceuticals, whose company is searching for 50,000 hectares in Africa, said Indian hemp is on high demand in Europe.
“It’s high time the Malawi government considered legalising the type of hemp that World Health Organisation has approved to shore up foreign exchange earnings as well as support the national export strategy and priority sectors of the government,” Mackintosh said.
But Secretary for Agriculture, Grey Nyandule Phiri, said cultivation of the crop is prohibited.

0one’s perception of the product and the regulations which will govern its growth.
Industrial hemp is not marijuana. The two may belong to the same family, indeed the same species, but they are different strains of the species (Cannabis sativa). They look alike to the uninitiated eye, but industrial hemp grows taller than marijuana. The part of the industrial hemp plant that is most useful is the stalk, hence the plant has been bred to have tall stalks.
The major difference between industrial hemp and marijuana lies in the content of an element known as tetrahydrocannibol (THC). It is this element which makes marijuana psychoactive and industrial hemp not. People may smoke as much industrial hemp as they would want, but it will not make them high because its THC content is low, typically between 0.05 percent and one percent. By contrast, marijuana has THC content varying between three percent and 20 percent, sometimes even higher. It is for this reason that marijuana is often used for recreational purposes. Industrial hemp cannot be used for such purposes.
Another element present in both these plants is cannabidiol (CBD). CBD content is higher in industrial hemp than in marijuana. It inhibits the psychoactive effect of THC and therefore makes the difference between the two strains of cannabis even greater.
Industrial hemp is the raw material that can be converted to a whole range of products, including rope, textiles, durable paper, insulating building blocks, biodegradable plastic, biofuel, food and animal feed. Its economic value, therefore, is immense.
However, its cultivation can be very tricky because some people who may be up to no goodwill, in all likelihood, mix it with marijuana or indeed grow a 100 percent crop of marijuana under the pretext of growing industrial hemp. For this reason not many countries have legalised the cultivation of industrial hemp. When I last checked, only 14 states out of 33, had legalised it in the United States of America.
The Government of Malawi, or whatever relevant authority, needs to be vigilant to ensure that cultivation of industrial hemp is not abused. I would like to propose a few regulations. First, only licensed people should be allowed to grow it. To obtain that licence, one will have to submit a comprehensive application, which will need to be subsequently scrutinised. If, and only if, the mandated authority is satisfied that the applicant is a person with a good reputation in society, should the licence be issued.
During the cultivation of the crop, inspectors must frequently visit the field(s) to take samples and conduct trials to check on the THC content of the crop. Should this exceed an allowable maximum level, the crop should be commandeered by the relevant authority and destroyed.
In the initial stages, the cultivation must perhaps happen on a pilot basis. Very few growers should be allowed to grow industrial hemp under strict surveillance from Government. This can go on for a period of, say, five years, to allow for the teething problems to be smoothed out. After that period, a few more growers can be allowed to grow it. Meanwhile, the laws prohibiting growing and trafficking of marijuana must remain in force.
Yes, strict measures will be absolutely necessary; otherwise, abuse of the crop will easily negate its potential economic benefits. A nation whose citizens are perpetually high on marijuana will suffer from warped judgment on issues, a recipe for plunging the country into a deep social and economic abyss.  Industrial hemp can easily become a curse rather than the blessing it is meant to be. So, we need to tread very carefully indeed.
I would urge authorities to conduct an honest search within our structures and come up with fool proof methodologies of growing industrial hemp to maximise the benefits from its enormous potential while ensuring that it is not abused. n"

Mhen, Drug Fight call for research on hemp
Tom Sangala
May 22, 2015
305 1 minute readAdvertisement
The Malawi Health Equity Network (Mhen) and Drug Fight Malawi have called for proper research on a proposal Member of Parliament for Ntchisi North Constituency Boniface Kadzamira made to legalise the sale of Indian hemp (Chamba or Marijuana) to boost the country’s economy.
Mhen Executive Director Martha Kwataine and Executive Director for Drug Fight Malawi Nelson Zakeyo made the appeal in separate interviews on Wednesday.
“We have to research whether the benefits will be more than the negatives. Malawians are people that are not good at being responsible for their lives. The other thing is how will Malawians differentiate between the ordinary Indian hemp and the other one which is being advocated for?” said Kwataine.

She said people must not only look at the economic gains of the weed but should also put the lives of Malawians first.
Kwataine also said although legalising Indian hemp can help to generate resources for the country, there is need to look into the cost of such a decision.
She said already there are a lot of problems which the country is facing in the health sector, including mental illnesses.

“We may end up creating an environment where people are free to smoke Chamba and becoming mentally ill,” explained Kwataine.
Commenting on the issue, Zakeyo said it would be very difficult to know which Indian hemp has lesser chemicals.
“Let them do a research and give us evidence of the kind of Indian hemp that is being advocated for because as far as we are concerned, we just know one type of the weed. Indian hemp is very harmful to human health more especially to the youth,” he said.
Zakeyo said legalising Indian hemp can encourage youths to smoke.
He also said unless a research is conducted and it is recommended by Chitedze Research Station, his organisation does not buy the idea.
Kadzamira said in Parliament that legalising chamba is a viable alternative to boost the country’s foreign exchange earnings.

195,195,https://www.nyasatimes.com/legal-hemp-malawi-rope-not-dope-larger-picture-albino-attacks/,www.nyasatimes.com,hemp,"Legal hemp for Malawi, rope not dope: Larger picture on albino attacksJune 20, 2016 Thom Chiumia - Nyasa Times 3 CommentsA landmark decision was made last week by our Parliament. The ‘august House’ adopted a motion tabled by Ntchisi North Constituency parliamentarian, Boniface Kadzamira, that government must legalize the cultivation and use of the industrial Hemp in Malawi.
Industrial Hemp is from the plant species ‘Cannabis sativa’ and has been used worldwide to produce a variety of industrial and consumer products. Hemp is also a source of fiber and oilseed.
Many MPs, both from the opposition and government side, spoke in support of the motion.  Minister of Health, Dr. Peter Kumpalume brought in a technical perspective to the debate. He ‘schooled’ the House that Industrial Hemp is high in fiber and low in active tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana that makes some cannabis varieties a valued drug.
Kumpalume, a trained medical doctor and MP Blantyre West legislator, said like in all countries where production of Industrial Hemp is legalized, Malawi will have to strictly regulate the THC levels of Industrial Hemp, which should be less than 0.3 percent, compared to THC levels of between 3 to 30 percent in marijuana.
The most exciting contribution came from the Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development, Dr. George Chaponda.
While agreeing with many sentiments about the economic benefits of Industrial Hemp, the Minister was clearly, surprised that the many economies that were touted to have benefitted immensely from Industrial Hemp production included China, Canada, France and the United States of America.
No African country was ever mentioned, not even from the SADC where Malawi belongs to, to have benefitted from Industrial Hemp. The Minister of Agriculture then emphasized on the need that control measures shall have to be put right in place to avoid abuse of the ‘real’ marijuana in the light of the legalization of Industrial Hemp.
Chaponda cited an example of law enforcers detaining someone at a roadblock “for being found in possession of marijuana” and another being let free for “possessing Industrial Hemp”. The Minister envisioned a scenario, in the absence of strict controls, where the former would argue that they both deserve freedom!
Real benefits and the people factor
Never mind the merits and demerits of the debate on Industrial Hemp in Parliament, there is one thing remains clear: We have a progressive Parliament that will stop at nothing in order to ensure that the country’s economic woes are stopped once and for all.
Literature has it that Industrial Hemp has many uses, including paper manufacturing, textiles, biodegradable plastics, construction, health food, and fuel.
It is one of the fastest growing biomasses known and one of the earliest domesticated plants known.  It also runs parallel with the “Green Future” objectives that are becoming increasingly popular.
Furthermore, hemp can be used to replace many potentially harmful products, such as tree paper (the processing of which uses chlorine bleach), which results in the waste product polychlorinated dibensodioxins, popularly known as dioxins, which are carcinogenic, and contribute to deforestation, cosmetics, and plastics, most of which are petroleum-based and do not decompose easily. The strongest chemical needed to whiten the already light hemp paper is non-toxic hydrogen peroxide.
A long and very strong ‘bast’ fibre, hemp fibre has been used for thousands of years to manufacture clothing, twines, ropes and cordage, and is an excellent complement to fibres such as flax, silk, nettle and cotton in fabric blends.
So, Industrial Hemp can be a perfect substitute to tobacco and other cash crops. But as emphasized by some of the legislators, there should be massive civic education for Malawians to appreciate the difference between ‘chamba’ and Industrial Hemp. Not many Malawians will appreciate the difference at face value.
Remember one Joe Manduwa? He is credited for being the first Malawian MP to advocate for the legalization of marijuana. He was demonized in many quarters, including government for preaching alien stuff.
Manduwa may have been referring to Industrial Hemp, after all! But in the absence of adequate literature and civic education, he was ‘misunderstood’. We don’t want to misunderstand you, Hon. Boniface Kadzamira, Dr. Kumpalume and all. We’re tired of poverty.
Albinos: Parliament moves, Nkhoma Synod adds voice
On Sunday, a pastoral letter was read in all churches under the Nkhoma Synod of the CCAP. The main gist of the matter was the albino executions. The Church must be commended for adding its voice against this albino ‘brutality’.
The pastoral letter came a few days after Parliament also agreed that laws that directly relate to the killings of the albinos, such as the Anatomy Act, must be amended so that culprits suffer heavy punishment, including life sentences, when convicted.
Well and good! But let me say here without fear of contradiction that in most instances, criminals do not think about the kind of prison sentence their intended crime will attract. These are criminals bent on committing a crime and they just do it! For example, albino hunters and killers are concerned more about how rich they may get than how many years they would spend in the cooler by indulging in merciless killings of albinos.
So, while amending the laws to severely punish albino killers may go a long way to deter future killers, we ought to seriously work on adopting of ‘prevention is better than cure’ approach.
It is imperative that our government must work out a solid plan to fight poverty among citizens so that ‘lazy bones’ don’t merely think of killing fellow humans to get a better life. Legalization of the production of Industrial Hemp is surely one of the ways.
Malawi has always been a ‘land of milk and honey’. It is incumbent upon our leaders to be on course to inspire the people out of their poverty. Yes, there are always ‘valleys and mountains’ on this journey but with the right and inspiring leadership in place, we can make it happen; we can achieve.
The President and his government must create an enabling environment where people should be able to pursue their dreams with higher energy. Our leaders must instill a sense of ‘self-belief’ in the people where citizens are encouraged that whatever challenges we face, as a nation, there is a turnaround moment around the corner. This, they must be able to demonstrate through their actions.

199,199,https://mwnation.com/questions-about-industrial-hemp/,mwnation.com,hemp,"Questions about industrial hempby Gloria Masula & Chimwemwe Manyozo 27/06/2016 in My Turn 3 min read
0On June 16 2016, Parliament resolved that government should legalise the growing and use of industrial hemp both at policy and legislative levels.
This news was received with excitement, especially within the community of those who trade and smoke Indian hemp (chamba) or marijuana. They sang Marlon Ashley’s Ganja farmer until when they heard that industrial hemp is far different from marijuana.
Marijuana gets you high, industrial hemp if smoked can only produce a massive headache. It does not make one feel high.
Experience from countries that have legalised industrial hemp shows that it did not affect enforcement of laws against use of marijuana; of course, they have to deal with general misconception.
According to Forbes, industrial hemp is a renewable resource which has been used for various industrial applications, including making paper, textiles and cordage.
It has also been used in health foods, organic body care, clothing, construction materials, biofuels, plastic composites and more. It has been argued that more than 25 000 products can be made from industrial hemp.
The multiple use industrial hemp boasts presents a tremendous opportunity for countries like Malawi to invest in its growing and use. We just need to ask how Malawi’s produce will fare on the global market against that from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Spain and 20 more countries.
Industrial hemp is both the present and the future. With the evident effects of climate change and theories of planet boundaries, industrial hemp provides an alternative to failing cash crops as a result of climate change.
It reduces deforestation by providing biofuel, lowers carbon emissions and air pollution and enriches the soil.
Fabric made from hemp do not have chemical residue and is, therefore, safer for consumers. Hemp products can be recycled and are 100 percent biodegradable. If properly harnessed, industrial hemp will undoubtedly improve Malawi’s economy.
But who are the winners and losers in the industrial hemp adventure?
If we are to go by experience, one contentious issue has been the monopoly of multinational corporations controlling the local seed market. The companies have both capacity and expertise to produce different seed varieties based on market demand.
This has naturally affected local breeding systems which also depend on the multinational seed companies to produce seeds. Eventually, the production and sale of industrial hemp seed varieties benefit foreign companies.
What strategies will, thus, be employed to ensure that local breeding systems are strengthened? Who gets to grow industrial hemp and who sets its buying and selling price?
Again, going by the tobacco experience, one issue has been the tendency of buyers setting prices that end up ripping farmers off.
The general perception is that industrial hemp is the answer to many economic problems in different countries. There is likelihood that countries like Malawi will allocate more resources to growing industrial hemp. Thus, we might end up creating a single-crop mentality.
As such, while considering investment in industrial hemp, there is need to consider giving similar attention to various cash crops with a ready global market.
Let us be careful with the choices we make now so as not to affect the future. Let us avoid putting all our eggs in one basket, but rather focus on other things or crops that are equally important and valuable as others.
As a country, we have potential in industrial hemp, tobacco, tea and a number of other crops with a ready global market."

On the saddle: Pigeon peas, not hemp, is what can help Malawi
Tom Sangala
June 21, 2016
289 2 minutes readAdvertisement
There is currently a lot of excitement in Malawi about prospects of industrial hemp as a commercial and export crop for the country. The Ministry of Agriculture is currently running trial production of the crop at Chitedze Research Station in Lilongwe while Parliament last week approved a private member’s bill supporting legalisation of the crop.
Indeed Malawi requires a variety of crops that can provide opportunities for commercial farming and exports on a large scale and earn the country the much needed foreign exchange. And industrial hemp can be one of them.
What is misleading, however, are assertions that once Malawi starts cultivating industrial hemp, all its economic problems will be over. The belief that industrial hemp could bring economic miracles to Malawi is grossly an illusion.

While no single crop would ever replace tobacco as Malawi’s main commercial and export crop, pigeon peas actually has a bigger potential to become a bigger export crop for the country than industrial hemp.
The claims by hemp activists are often exaggerated. Industrial hemp is indeed a useful and highly versatile crop. But its utility is, for the most part, fairly marginal, at least going by existing markets and estimates around the world.
Demand for hemp isn’t as high as proponents would have it. In Europe, demand has been on the decline for several years as buyers have increasingly opted for cheaper or better alternatives—mostly artificial fibres, for many applications.

In the Unites States, imports of hemp-based products — many of them from China — have been legal since 1998. But the total retail market for hemp in the United States is only about $500 million and the market is widely not expected to grow much further.
Even the US Department of Agriculture believes the market potential for hemp will remain small “like those for sesame and poppy seeds.”
Hemp is therefore not the trillion-dollar crop that could finally allow Malawians grow money on trees. And it will take some time and a lot of work for the regulatory environmental and market structures to facilitate proper handling of the crop.
On the other hand, Malawi already grows a number of crops that have huge potential on the export market and only require a little more organisation and motivation for the farmer. Pigeon pea is one of such crops.
The production of this crop is largely concentrated around the Indian subcontinent and east Africa, with Malawi currently rated as the largest producer in Africa while Tanzania is the largest exporter on the continent.
According to the India Pulses and Grain Association, however, most of the pigeon peas exported by Tanzania are from Malawi and this is because of Malawi’s failure to control informal exports across its borders.
With consumers become increasingly conscious about nutrition and concerns about animal-proteins emerging, legumes such as pigeon peas are gaining importance in healthy food habits. This is making the market for legumes like pigeon peas wider.
According to Food and Agriculture Organisation, production of pigeon peas has been on an upward trend over the past decade, with India as the largest producer at 70 percent of global production followed by Myanmar, producing more than 20 percent of global production. Africa accounts for the majority of the remaining production, with Malawi leading at 6 percent of global production, Kenya and Uganda at two percent each while Tanzania accounts only for 0.8 percent of global production.
The largest market for pigeon peas is also in India where demand is also increasing, although the area under cultivation and the yields have remained stagnant, with some downtrend shown in recent years.
India now imports pigeon peas from Africa and Myanmar, with estimates showing that the country requires 500,000 metric tonnes of imports annually to satisfy its domestic requirements.
Although it is not one of the major producers, Tanzania is Africa biggest exporter of pigeon peas to India and its varieties are considered the best in India.
Shockingly though is the fact most of the pigeon peas from Tanzania is actually from Malawi which is also considered another good source of pigeon peas into India, with annual shipments estimated at between 50,000 and 100,000 metric tonnes.
Malawi can therefore easily become a major producer and exporter of pigeon peas if authorities only found ways of formalising exports while working with farmers to increase production and yields. On the other hand, it will take ages for Industrial Hemp to reach the potential pigeon peas already offers to Malawi.

Written by Winstone Kaimira
Thursday, 03/02/2022Nkhotakota District Council has disclosed its plan of promoting industrial hemp farming in the northern part of the district, where production of illegal Indian hemp is common.
Acting District Commissioner, Ben Tohno, says the move will assist people of the area as they will now be investing in producing hemp which is both lawful and profitable.
“Those people who are cultivating Indian hemp, should at this point focus on growing the legalized industrial hemp, we already know that the places are suitable for growing that industrial hemp, but we will still involve the research institutions,” said Tohno.
He told Zodiak Online in an interview that this is part of the economic transformation of the district through agricultural activities, an intervention that will lead to the opening of mega-farms, for the production of various crops.
The Acting DC said the move will assist in addressing the perception that there is massive production of Indian hemp in Nkhotakota district as a whole.
Meanwhile, Senior Chief Kanyenda of the district, says some of his subjects have already shown interest to grow industrial hemp.
“I look at cultivation of industrial hemp as an alternative to cultivation of the ordinary Chamba, which is illegal,” said the traditional leader.
But both the traditional leader and the DC are calling for support from well-wishers, to ensure people do not hide behind this, to grow illegal hemp.
They also want financial support for farmers who are forming cooperatives to cultivate industrial hemp.

0President Peter Mutharika has approved cultivation of industrial hemp for trial purposes in the country, according to Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development Allan Chiyembekeza.
Chiyembekeza said in an interview that following the approval, processes for the same started last month for growing of industrial hemp.

The minister said: “Let me point out that industrial hemp is different from the much talked Indian hemp [chamba or Cannabis Sativa] that is prohibited. This [industrial] hemp does not contain the psychoactive chemical elements that affect people when smoked even though it is from the same family of crops.”
Chiyembekeza said if the trials are successful, this could be an opportunity for diversifying the economy and widening the sources of foreign exchange earnings. He said the crop could also support the National Export Strategy (NES).
Introducing her company yesterday at a function hosted by British High Commission in Lilongwe, Invegro Hemp Power Malawi founder Tanya Clerk said her firm is excited with the President’s nod to the trial of industrial hemp.
She said industrial hemp is a crop with extremely exciting economic potential and could support the NES of oil seed cluster in Malawi.
Clerk said Chitedze Research Station in Lilongwe is set to carry out the trials .Industrial hemp is currently grown in 36 countries, including United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Russia and China.
In Malawi, there have been several calls to grow industrial hemp with some even suggesting that the illegal Indian hemp be formally exported to diversify foreign exchange earnings.

Mzuzu Police Spokesperson Edward Longwe confirmed the arrest of Kondwani Zulu, 35, of Kachilenga Village, Traditional Authority Mzukuzuku in Mzimba district who is currently in Police custody pending investigations.
Longwe said Zulu was arrested after Police discovered eight plants in a garden at his yard.

“Police had gone to crime scene in Katoto Township. Unfortunately the crime scene turned to be a place next to Zulu’s house. Afterdoing their job. Our CID officers decided to take a short cut that passes through his yard.
“That is when they discovered eight well tendered plants. They appeared pruned suggesting that harvesting did take place,” the Police spokeman said.
Longwe said the CID then called Zulu, who was at the office, to come home.
“They arrested him at home and took him to Police,” he said.
He has been charged with an offence of cultivating Indian hemp which is contrary to regulation 4 of the Dangerous Drugs Regulations.
Zulu, who has been taking head on on cops involved in bribery, was realeased on bail
Malawi Police Service faces a lot of challenges which expose the country to continued drug production and trafficking.
Legalise?
In 2000, Deputy Minister of Agriculture Joe Manduwa surprised MPs in the august House when championed Indian hemp’s legalisation.
Manduwa argued that Malawi stood to gain a great deal from cultivating the plant, which he said was a much-sought-after commodity on the world market and could be a valuable alternative to tobacco.
A recent World Bank study says Malawi’s cannabis has a street value of $8.5 million (K1.4 billion) – about 0.2 percent of the country’s GDP.
“Since Malawi farmers receive only about a fifth of the price for which it’s being sold on foreign consumer markets, the positive effect of the production of cannabis on the overall Malawi economy is negligible,”says the Bank in a study done in last year.

In an interview when the police burnt the consignment at Machinjiri Township on Saturday, Chileka Police spokesperson, Grace Mwale, said people who were caught with the consignment are still at large after they bolted when MRA officials intercepted them.
“So far our investigations have not revealed the real owner [of the hemp] but the van which was used to transport the consignment has been handed over to the owner as there is no link between the owner and the consignment,” said Mwale.
She also said the consignment has been burnt following tests conducted at Bvumbwe Research Station proved it was indeed chamba.

Zakeyu (centre) against legal hemp
Nelson Zakeyu of Drug Fight Malawi says a research which his organisation undertook recently shows that half of the youth in Malawi are now on marijuana since parliament passed the law to legalise the growing of industrial hemp.
Industrial hemp is different from indian hemp in that industrial hemp is used for making things from cosmetics to clothes.
“Half of the youth are now smoking indian hemp in public, in open places in football matches, bus depots or colleges, even in full view of the police. They think the government has legalised indian hemp,” he said.
Zakeyu said the government should engage in massive civic education and sensitization meetings on the issue before the matter gets out of hand.
Information minister Nicholas Dausi says the government is putting in place measures that would put the situation under control.

0  As debate on legalisation of the use of industrial hemp continues, a South Africa-based researcher has thrown weight behind it, saying it can boost the country’s economy.
In an interview last week, the researcher and managing director of Ikaros Africa Sandro Righini said Malawi has an equal chance with other African countries such as South Africa to register an economic boom if it invests in growing industrial hemp.
Kuwali: There is need to follow procedures
He said: “Ikaros Africa has been engaging government for the last three years to bring medical hemp to Malawi. We had a lot of assistance from the government of Malawi as it is very much behind this initiative.
“The benefits of bringing the industry are that we will be creating jobs, economic growth, and direct foreign investment. We will also be opening a global market to Malawi which is currently worth $20 billion a year.”
Righini said the product has reliable markets in North America, Canada, Spain, Switzerland, Italy and Poland.
In a written response yesterday, Civil Society on Agriculture Network (CisaNet) executive director Pamela Kuwali supported claims that the industry can help improve the country’s development.
But she warned that systems need to be put in place to prevent abuse of the substance.
She said: “While industrial hemp promises potential to contribute to economic growth, if Malawi decides to legalise it, it would be critical to ensure enough legal provision to seal any loopholes for abuse.”
On his part, Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation Water and Development Grey Nyandule Phiri said: “Potential investors have been meeting different government officials. So far we have made trials on the industry and we have not yet analysed the paper for us to move to the next step.
“However, we will present the issue to Cabinet. If it is something good for the country, then we want it to be done properly, knowing that other countries have their own safeguards.”
According to Ikaros Africa-Malawi office, the organisation has from 2015 spent over K380 million on research at Chitara Research Centre in Salima.
Righini, who said his company has been exporting products made from marijuana crop, claims Malawi stands a chance of gaining over $100 million (about K75 billion) annually from sales of marijuana products.
Information sourced from www.mcdsa.co.za indicates that products made from industrial cannabis can be used for treating ailments such as cancer, diabetes and many others.

Raghini: Hmep to boost Malawi’s economy
CisaNet says industrial Hemp growing needs to follow proper procedures
He said his company Ikaros Africa is currently registered under Malawi Investment Trade Centre (MITC) as well as Ministry of Agriculture for Hemp productions.
Righini says the company has already invested K380 million in its trial stage of industrial hemp.
“We will be bringing creating jobs economic growth and direct foreign investment. We will also be opening a global market in Malawi which is currently worth $20 billion a year,” he said.
He said Malawi has always relied on tobacco as its main cash crop, but with the majority of the world turning away from cigarettes, causing a rapid decline in demand for tobacco, hemp is becoming the alternative.
“With over 50 years of cumulative experience in the medicinal hemp industry, Ikaros Africa brings their pride and joy to the heart of Malawi,” he said.
Righini said medical Hemp has reliable markets in North America, Canada, Spain, Switzerland, Italy and Poland.
He said the trials are being done at Chitala and Bvumbwe research stations.
Meanwhile, the Civil Society on Agriculture Network (CisaNet) has supported the claim that hep industry can help improve the country’s development.

Gondwa added that the law-enforcers have found 86 brand new blankets in Mtungama’s house during a search.
Police investigations revealed that the blankets belonged to the prison department and were to be distributed to the prisoners.

0Police on Tuesday raided an Indian hemp (chamba) farm inside Nkhotakota Game Reserve where they uprooted and destroyed over three acres of the illicit drug.
Police say the operation was jointly carried out by police, villagers from Bamba and parks, wildlife and game reserve rangers from the district, who discovered the farm while officials from the courts, district council and faith leaders were witnesses.
Nkhotakota Police Station spokesperson Williams Kaponda said on Wednesday, the three-acre farm was situated along the banks of Likowa River, which borders Senior Chief Mwadzama and Traditional Authority (T/A) Mwansambo’s areas.
He said the exercise, which is a major breakthrough in the war against chamba cultivation, came a few days after the discovery of the farm by the parks and wildlife officials, who reported the matter to police.
Kaponda said so far, noone has been arrested in connection with the cultivation of the Indian hemp, which were burnt using 120 litres of petrol and 150 litres of diesel.
Meanwhile, the police spokesperson said they were yet to uproot and destroy other Indian hemp plantations discovered at Mwalawamphasa and Kanjedza villages.

0Following successful industrial hemp trials at Chitedze Research Station in Lilongwe, government has approved to have the trials conducted in other environments.
The station has so far tested 10 varieties acquired from Europe, China and Australia to assess if they have low levels of the substance that drive people crazy when they smoke marijuana. The trials, which started in 2015, are expected to end this year.
Speaking during presentation of the findings at this year’s annual review and planning meeting in Mzuzu on Tuesday, Department of Agriculture Research Services (Dars) chief scientist Laurent Pungulani said the trials have established that the varieties have lower levels of the substance compared to the limit set by the international community.
He said following the Chiteze Research Station trials, Dars has given the go-ahead to have the varieties tested in other places.
“I have in mind Chitala Research Station which has a completely different environment from Chitedze because it is very hot. Probably, we will have to have another trial where temperatures are low and a good example could be Bvumbwe Research Station because it is cooler and receives high rainfall,” said Pungulani.
InveGrow director Tanya Clarke, whose company is a stakeholder in the trials, said some foreign investors are already inquiring about the industrial hemp although some are confusing it with marijuana.
“We are getting a lot of interest coming our way from international investors, but there is still confusion on marijuana and industrial hemp. We are now explaining this to international companies and making sure that they are not thinking that it is marijuana,” she said."

He said a moment later two men pulled to the scene whilst driving a Toyota vista saloon bearing a Zambian registration number AAQ 5223.
“They told the Officers that they were the owners of the bags and offered bribes to let the truck free but the officers turned down the offer. The Officers then arrested the alleged traffickers,” the Police Publicist said.
The alleged traffickers have been identified as Ali Alan Abdu, aged 42, of Makanjira village, Traditional Authority Katuri in Mangochi district and Harrison Banda, aged 23 years, of Saluti village, Traditional Authority khosolo in Mzimba district.
Police have since charged the duo with Being Found in Possession of Hemp Indian without License under regulation 4A of the Dangerous Drug Regulation as read with section 19(1) of the Dangerous Drug Act.
In a related development Nkhunga Police on October 8th 2012 also impounded 47 bags of Indian hemp which were concealed in an ERF truck registration number PE 2054 which was carrying 31 tons of coal destined for Blantyre.
Police arrested the driver Levi Mpata aged 31, of Kachikumba village, Traditional Authority Mtwalo in Mzimba district. The truck belongs to Mr. Prince Nthambazale of Nthambazale Transport in Mzuzu.
Nkhunga Second Grade Magistrate Court has since slapped Mpata with a 10 year imprisonment with hard labour jail term.
And during the night of the 19th to 20th October, 2012 Nkhunga Police also impounded a truck which had 43 bags of Indian hemp and arrested four suspects in the process
The suspects had creatively concealed the hemp inside bags containing maize and rice husks (Madeya) in order to evade scrutiny at Police check points. The hemp was destined for Blantyre.

0Invegrow Limited, a company behind industrial hemp research and production, says it plans to invest $15 million (about K11 billion) in the first three years of its commercial production of industrial hemp-related products.
a researcher showcases products made from industrial hemp
This comes against the backdrop of the company investing $1 million (K738 million) to establish a factory to be commissioned in June this year.
The factory is located at Kasiya in Lilongwe, which is 20 kilometres from the city of Lilongwe and it is expected to be producing on pilot phase hemp oil for human consumption and industrial use.
Invegrow Limited director Nebert Nyirenda said in an interview that factory equipment was already imported and installation plans are advancing well.
He said the major bottleneck is the pending power connectivity by Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi (Escom) which may delay installation of the factory machines, adding that all other activities are on course.
Said Nyirenda: “Commencement of the production is much dependent on how Escom will quickly connect us to the power grid. Our plan is that we should commission the factory atest by June this year.
“Even if the licensing for production of products may delay; we can go ahead to commission the factory because it is a generic equipment that can be used to process any type of vegetable oil.”
He said industrial oil is used as an ingredient into other industrial products.
In terms of investment, Nyirenda said after investing $1 million (about K738 million) in the first phase of production and the market responds well, they will go full commercial and embark on phase two with a total investment between $10 to $15 million.
He said apart from the local market, the company is also targeting the export markets.
“We know that hemp value chain is worth about $9 billion dollars world over so that is the basis of our markets. The markets are there, the $9 billion dollar is there as a full cake and we want to eat part of that cake of the $9 billion dollar industry.
“We have markets in Europe, we have markets in southern Africa, we have markets in European Union, we have markets in America and in China so the market is big just as good as tobacco that is where we want to take a bit of our businesses pie,” said Nyirenda."

0  Advocates of industrial hemp legalisation have applauded President Peter Mutharika for giving consent to researchers to conduct trials.
Cultivation of the crop for trial purposes started at Chitedze Research Station in Lilongwe in August this year following Mutharika’s endorsement.
Chamba is illegal in Malawi
Kamet Forum Malawi, a network of citizens who have been behind the push for legalisation of industrial hemp, says Mutharika made a brave, but wise decision.
The trials are being conducted by a local company, Invegro Hemp Power Malawi, to ascertain the viability of industrial hemp becoming a viable cash crop for Malawi.
“In giving a nod to this kind of research, the President has demonstrated that he is a true statesman who does not only call for innovative minds to come up with new ideas, but also geared to providing conducive environment for such innovative ideas to be objectively assessed for viability,” reads part of Kemet’s letter to Mutharika’s chief economic adviser Collins Magalasi.
The letter, signed by chairperson Sangwani Msofi and secretary Alvin Ngoma , says Mutharika’s determination will not go unnoticed by Malawians who are looking for alternatives to diversify the economy’s reliance on tobacco as the major export.
The organisation has since requested the Ministry of Industry and Trade to consider formulating deliberate policies towards empowering indigenous businesses to invest in the industry."

0  Cultivation and subsequent use of industrial hemp could be the solution to solving Malawi’s unrelenting economic challenges, executive director of Malawi Watch, Billy Banda, has said.
Speaking on Monday in an interview in Lilongwe, Banda urged donors who are not directly financing government, to channel resources to research of industrial hemp.
Said Banda: “Industrial hemp is not for smoking and I am confident both the former and current proponents are not smokers, but simply think of the benefits.”
Chiyembekeza: Trials will take years
Banda said by legalising the plant, potential benefits could be borne through the manufacturing of drugs, clothes, paper, cars, just to mention a few.
“Another positive aspect is the Malawi Pharmacy, Medicines and Poisons Board [PMPB] will be mandated to issue licenses and also certify which variety is grown and in what quantity,” he said.
Banda said government is struggling to convince the buyer to buy tobacco at fair price.
Banda: Economically viable
In recent years, tobacco continued to face international pressure from the anti-smoking lobbyists championed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) through its Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) guidelines which seek to abolish tobacco farming in near future.
During the Vision 2020 consultations, the legalisation of industrial hemp was raised by former member of Parliament (MP) and then deputy minister of Agriculture Joe Manduwa.
Following Manduwa’s footsteps, incumbent member of Parliament for Ntchisi North Boniface Kadzamira has also caused uproar in Parliament earlier this year when he revived the campaign.
Meanwhile, industrial hemp trials are underway in Lilongwe.
The industrial hemp has been grown on a one hectare plot using certified seed imported from Canada, Australia and Europe. A commercial licence will be granted upon successful completion of the trials in 2016.
In an interview earlier with Business News Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development, Allan Chiyembekeza, said the research will take two to three years and if it works out it will only be cultivated in commercial farms.
“This is not chamba [marijuana]. It is a new introduction and the leaves do not contain much substance that is hallucinating as chamba itself,” Chiyembekeza said.
He said the role of government has been to introduce the species and researchers will do chemical analysis to see how it compares with chamba to ascertain if the chemical content is indeed different. n

0  The backlash against a sudden ban on Frozy fizzy drinks smuggled from Mozambique is not entirely symptomatic of a nation in love with foreign goods.
The public outcry is laced with undertones of citizens who wish Malawi Bureau of Standards (MBS) had acted earlier to safeguard consumers from hazardous goods.
“We like good things,” Zingwangwa resident Andrew Gama says. “When they come cheaper, we cry for more. It is puzzling that MBS allowed Malawians to consume Frozy for almost a year if the drink puts lives at risk.”
The youthful citizen rightly notes that the regulator has a life-or-death duty to ensure no one tastes hurtful products.
But MBS was not only sluggish in clamping down on the influx of the beverage that took the country by storm as early as February.
Banned, but still in business as debate continues: Frozy
It is struggling to eliminate stockpiles of the drinks said to contain excessive citric acids and sodium benzoate, which cause cancers.
When MBS director general Devlin Chokazinga outlawed further importation, distribution and consumption of the commodity, he asked people “to declare the remaining stocks for appropriate clearing”.
But the response seems slow.
On the southern borders, smugglers are busy shipping in more stacks-evading tax much to the disappointment of Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) which spoke against the illegal imports almost a month before MBS came barking like a bulldog.
Some Malawians are worried that the tax collectors acted faster than the bureau which is supposed to safeguard lives.
Chokazinga says it was difficult to swiftly detect inflow of Frozy because smugglers use stealthy routes.
Despite being outlawed, it is still pouring in.
On the streets, its popularity is growing and bottles are being sold undercover.
From cooler boxes and refrigerators to shop shelves, Frozy now wears new colours and names.
On a scorching Saturday afternoon, The Nation entered Zingwangwa Market where   Frozy is selling like illegal drugs as shopkeepers ask several questions to ascertain the buyers are not spies.
At one shop, a trader said he gets more customers saying: “Can I have Frozy, please!”
He likened the banned business to sales of Indian hemp, saying: “It’s hot, but risky.”
The cautious seller explained: “We no longer keep it in the shop. We don’t want to be tricked.”
The traders say the crackdown has forced smugglers to stop using porous borders near Mwanza and switch to the vicinities of Muloza Border Post in Mulanje.
“The cartons are transported at night using vehicles and bicycles. The smugglers cross Muloza River, which runs between Malawi and Mozambique, to Ntambalika area where they are loaded in waiting vehicles destined for Blantyre and beyond,” said a wholesaler known as James.
Given the existing demand, he reportedly clears almost 200 dozens in two days at a wholesale price of K2 160 per dozen and K180 a bottle.
James says many people buy in bulks to hoard.
Frozy’s infiltration, popularity and affordability have marked its unusual standing as a forceful competitor of Fanta, Sprite and Coca-Cola whose availability in hard-to-reach localities is a global symbol of efficient marketing and distribution.
Unexpectedly, the ban has stirred a sensational reaction. Some Malawians asking: Why only Frozy?
“People are consuming liquids with higher acid concentration such as spirits, but you are busy banning fizzy drinks,” Duncan Msonthi wrote on MBS Facebook page.
Random interviews indicate a rampant suspicion that the order was somewhat prompted by an invisible hand, but MBS downplayed this conspiracy theory.
Samuel Kaphuka, a lecturer in international trade law at Chancellor College, finds the ban inconsistent with the country’s obligations under the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
He writes: “Considering the circumstances, it is not difficult to conclude that the ban constitutes a disguised restriction on trade, so as to afford protection to domestic products.
The health grounds articulated by MBS may not be far-reaching compared to other imported drinks, including cheap liquor, which have flooded the local markets.
Besides allegations of excessive taste enhancers and preservatives, which Frozy manufacturers deny, MBS kicked out the drink because its packaging bears Portuguese writings instead of Chichewa or English which are widely spoken in the country.
But the bureau has suffered some stick for failing to act on a flood of Asian products in superstores whose packaging bears incomprehensible Arabic, Chinese and Mandarin scribbles.
Asks Kaphuka: “Why do MBS seem to pay a blind eye to these?” n"

In a related development, an unknown woman was on Friday found gruesomely murdered and dumped by unidentified assailants in Bua River at Chidzuma Village, Traditional Authority Mphonde in the same district (Nkhotakota).
Nkhotakota Police Deputy Public Relations Officer (PRO) Paul Malimwe confirmed the development, saying the deceased was aged between 28 and 30 years old.
The deputy publicist explained that the dead body was found in a decomposed state with chopped left breast and several deep cuts in the head, hands and both legs.
Malimwe said postmortem at Nkhotakota District Hospital revealed the death was due to loss of blood following the cuts the deceased sustained.
Meanwhile, Police have instituted an investigation to bring to book suspects involved in the murder.
“We therefore ask the general public to assist where possible with any information which can lead to the arrest of the suspects,” said Malimwe.

0  Industrial hemp advocates have commended members of Parliament (MPs) for passing a motion to legalise cultivation and use of the product in the country.
The legislators on Thursday adopted a motion by Ntchisi North MP Boniface Kadzamira (Independent) for government to legalise industrial hemp.
It was the second time an MP had proposed legalisation of industrial hemp after then deputy ministry of Agriculture Joe Manduwa in April 2000.
The development has inspired Kemet Forum, a local network that has been advocating for hemp legalisation, which has commended the MPs for taking initial steps towards re-considering the status of industrial hemp.
Moved motion: Kadzamira
However, the network has implored the MPs to expedite in taking further steps to reform the existing laws and enact a bill on industrial hemp to facilitate the cultivation and processing under appropriate laws.
The particular laws Kemet wants to be amended include the Dangerous Drugs Act and the Noxious Weeds Act which both classify all varieties of cannabis, including industrial hemp, as substances or plants that are valueless and extremely harmful to society.
Kemet said the enacting of the bill would ensure that by-products are locally produced and exported hence earning the much needed forex.
Industrial hemp is a variety of cannabis that has no undesirable psychoactive effects associated with the other variety of cannabis called marijuana.
Statistics show over 20 000 scientific studies published over the last 10 years have confirmed that industrial hemp has enormous industrial and nutritional values unlike marijuana.
However, some MPs have stressed the need for government to exercise caution on the issue in order not to allow unscrupulous people to take advantage of the legislation to promote the growth of illicit Indian hemp (chamba).
Industrial hemp has several uses, including processing into bio-degradable plastics, construction materials, car/air craft body parts, clothing, oil, fuel, food, ropes and paper."

The owner of the consignment was identified as Christopher Mkuwu from Mangochi District. Mkuwu was immediately arrested and taken to Champhira Police Post.
MRA is further appealing to members of the general public to always report issues of any malpractices such as smuggling, tax evasion and corruption through the toll free number 847 for Airtel and TNM subscribers or 80000847 for MTL subscribers.
Informants can also send their tips to the Centre through email address: reportswqm@tip-offs.com or fax to 0182 229.

0Police in Blantyre have arrested 22-year-old Robert Austin for being found in possession of Indian hemp.
Blantyre police assistant spokesperson Andrew Mayawo said in an interview the police arrested Austin after a tip off from the public.
He said Austin was arrested at Wenela bus depot when he was about to board a minibus heading to Machinjiri Township in the city.
Austin, who hails from Ziyanjana Village in the area of Traditional Authority Nthiramanja in Mulanje, will appear in court soon to answer a charge of being found in possession of Indian hemp.
Still in Blantyre, police are keeping in custody two men, Francis Sefu, 24, and 19 year-old Chikondi Chiwanga for robbery.
The two are said to have attacked Allan Mwafulirwa and robbed him of a laptop at Chirimba trading centre at around 8 o’clock in the evening on Wednesday.
They will appear in court soon to answer charges of theft."

0A Nkhotakota Police Station 2015 report indicates that 71 people were convicted for illegal possession of Indian hemp (chamba) compared to 20 people in 2014, representing a139 percent increase.
Statistics in the report show that from January 1 to December 30 2015, 81 cases of illegal possession of hemp were recorded, of which 71 were convicted, four are remanded, two were acquitted while four are on police bail.

Nkhotakota Police Station spokesperson Williams Kaponda said in 2015, the station intensified its operations resulting in being recognised as the second best performers in the Central Region.
He said: “We worked hard because we wanted to eradicate crime. The station management fully supported all initiatives that assisted in the fight against drug abuse. It is not a mean achievement to register 71 convictions from 20 the previous year.”
Kaponda also attributed the success to the cordial relationship between the police and communities who played an important role in whistle-blowing.
Kaponda said most of the arrests occurred at Kaombe Police Roadblock while others occurred during snap roadblocks, resthouse searches, monitoring uncharted routes and sweeping exercises."

    Parliament has given the nod to Ntchisi North member of Parliament (MP) Boniface Kadzamira (Independent) to draft a bill whose objective is to distinguish the criminalised Indian hemp from medicinal cannabis through cultivation, production and possession.
Kadzamira moved a motion for the House to allow him to draft the bill following vigorous consultations which have proved that cannabis can improve the country’s economy if well regulated and legalised.
Kadzamira:It will encompass two varieties
In an interview after the motion was accepted, Kadzamira said his motion was a move in the right direction, saying there is need to define the terms rightly, hinting that the bill will encompass two varieties of cannabis—industrial and medicinal.
He said: “The bill will encompass the two varieties, thus the industrial hemp and medicinal cannabis, but before it is tabled, it will go to five committees for scrutiny. At that stage we will know what Malawians will want to be included in the bill.”
Kadzamira said he will seek advice from the Legal Department of Parliament on how to go about the bill which he hopes will be presented in the House next Thursday.
Many MPs, both government and opposition, supported the motion but warned that there should be vigorous research and right definitions of cannabis to avoid confusion with the hemp that is an illegal substance.
Blantyre West MP Peter Kumpalume (Democratic Progressive Party-DPP) said the country needs to move fast to adopt some technologies and inventions, one of which being hemp but said it has to be done cautiously.
“We need to move fast. I know there is money and a lot of benefits. We need research and to change the laws so that there won’t be abuse. I, therefore, support the motion,” he said.
Responding to the motion, Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development Joseph Mwanamvekha said even though the move seems good, an extensive research needs to be done.
“This motion on chamba is quite sensitive. It requires extensive research because it is a plant which needs a lot of analysis and proper consultation so that whatever comes out will be beneficial to the country,” he said.
Parliament gave a go-ahead for industrial hemp trials at Chitedze Research Station and in Salima. The studies are still ongoing on whether it can become a viable export product after Kadzamira moved a motion for such some three years ago.
Three weeks ago, Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development, Gray Nyandule Phiri said in an interview that results for the trials of the industrial hemp are ready for analysis by Cabinet.
He said after three years of trial, the ministry is ready with the results which cannot be shared to the public yet.
Industrial hemp is the non-narcotic form of cannabis and is not psychoactive due to the low levels of tetrayhydrocannibinol (THC).
Different stakeholders in the hemp industry have been calling on government to speed up the process of legalising the growing of the hemp to make Malawi have an alternative forex earner apart from tobacco.
Currently, Zimbabwe, Morrocco and South Africa are reported to have legalised the growing of industrial hemp in Africa.
It is estimated that a kilogramme of industrial hemp fetches about K32 000 on the market and that there is potential direct annual benefit to Malawians in excess of K3 billion on 16.5 hectares or K195 million per five hectares.

Delays to authorise an investor to start growing and processing industrial hemp would cost Malawi about K75 billion ($50 million) in potential revenue as the firm has threatened to pull out of the country.
Ikaros Africa country operations director Chauncy Jere said Malawi Government was delaying the licence to enable his firm begin growing industrial hemp and process the crop into medicinal products.
In an interview on Saturday, he said the company, which is operating in a number of countries in Africa and other continents, is contemplating relocating its investment to Mozambique because of red tape.
Jere: We have made
an investment
He said: “We have made an investment of over K1.9 billion in three years. We have been operating with expectation that everything would be finalised soon.”
Jere said the company has been conducting trials in the country to assess the viability of growing cannabis.
He said Ikaros Africa has been conducting a research at Chitara in Salima where findings confirmed that the country can manage to grow the crop in abundance.
But Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development Principal Secretary Grey Nyandule Phiri denied knowledge of any information that the company is contemplating to pull out of the country.
In an interview, he proposed that the investor should wait until government puts in place the regulatory framework to govern growth and use of the industrial cannabis.
Said Nyandule Phiri: “No one has been given the licence. Government is putting the regulatory framework first, so everybody is waiting for that.”
He said the regulatory framework is expected to be finalised by the end of this year.
Economist Chikumbutso Kalilombe, who is also president of Economics Association of Malawi (Ecama), said in a telephone interview yesterday that government should consider giving the issue of industrial hemp the required attention so that it should not lose some of the opportunities that would help in boosting the country’s economy.
He said: “I do not have details on the processes Ikaros have been undertaking. But all what I can say is that government should give this issue a necessary attention.”
Research and development consultant on economic and social issues Collen Kalua warned that if the investor pulls out government will lose in terms of revenue collection from employees as well as the company.
The company’s threat comes days after the United States government had shown reluctance to keep buying the country’s tobacco, which has been one of the major sources for the country’s economy."

If there is one city in the world that throws one into a race of wild imaginations coupled with lots of questions, it is Amsterdam.
Since time immemorial, the Dutch capital has a weird but solid reputation for being an ‘anything goes’ city.
Moneymaker: Tourists to Amsterdam cannot resist the allure of De Wallen, a popular Red Light District
Amsterdam is a relaxed, tolerant and easy-going city, but rather it is the liberal approach to sex and cannabis that makes it legendary.
The city prides itself on embracing the fact that people may be into prostitution and soft drugs. And that it is only human. So instead of criminalising everything, they enjoy the honesty of it all.
As such, tourists to the city will not boast of visiting Amsterdam without experiencing one of those two or even both—at least for the curious ones.
It was the case with some of the delegates attending the World Aids Conference, the city hosted last month.
Who would not want to experience Amsterdam after hours on end of press conferences, discussions and sessions on HIV and Aids scientific researches, among others?
So hitting De Wallen, the famous Red Light District for some was a mental massage. In Dutch, they call it De Wallen because it means the walls.
Cannabis—popularly referred to as Mary and Juana—is currently illegal. However, Dutch lawmakers in 2017 approved a legislation that permits professional cultivation.
No wonder, Amsterdam’s central business district is littered with coffee shops which are allowed to store a certain amount of locally cultivated cannabis on the shelves, at a time.
Sundu (R) with musician Danny Kalima in Amsterdam
Consumers can purchase the drug as raw, or processed into well-packaged cookies, chocolates as well as ingredients for drinks.
Tourists mostly consider coffee shops as a form of entertainment. The coffee shops play a vital role in Dutch tourism.  Latest figures show that between 25 to 30 percent of people who visit Amsterdam spend time in coffee shops sampling cannabis.
Juxtaposed to the coffee shops on De Wallen are multitudes of buildings stretched along the famous red light district.
Sex is sold on De Wallen—Amsterdam’s popular Red Light District—where prostitution thrives. The trade is legal in the Netherlands but not on the streets.
That’s why prostitutes on De Wallen stand up behind a window and have their own room. The name “Red Light District” comes from the red neon lights that highlight where women are working.
Since October 2000, window prostitutes have been allowed to legally offer their services. Today, prostitutes in the Netherlands are also taxpayers.
As of 2014, the Red Light District and coffee shops or to put it frankly, sex and drugs— contributed 2.5 billion euros a year to the national economy, according to Dutch authorities.
Accompanied by a local called Perry, I was curious to visit the Red Light District.
In natural daylight, the area is less attractive as the more sordid aspects do not really reveal themselves. Simply put, it is less lively during the day but the district really comes to life when night falls.
So on this particular late Friday afternoon, Perry—a Dutchman and stranger, I met three days earlier turned friend—played the role of a tour guide around the district.
As we strolled along the street, beautiful women of different shapes and sizes from almost all angles across the globe tapped from the windows beckoning for a sumptuous action.
Almost every woman shares at least an indistinct resemblance with her scantily clad and lace-adorned slender colleague in the next window.
“How many of such windows are in Amsterdam?” I asked Perry as curiosity got the best of me.
He responded, “300.”
As we maneuvered through the historical buildings from which the window rests, the more inquisitive I became.
Sensing the barrel of questions I was about to throw at him, Perry quickly said: “You see, let’s come this evening and see what happens during the night.”
The real macho starts from around 11pm when the district is swelling with crowds, both locals and tourists. The not so- beautiful alleys undergo a total transformation as the red neon lights illuminate them together with the countless inky canals.
The women, each in their small room and behind a window, glow as the red neon lights brighten their skin into silky membranes.
As we walked into one of the pubs, my mind raced to what Perry said earlier on that there is more that happens in the Amsterdam Red Light District other than just prostitution and coffee shops.
“The district offers cultural activities such as the Museum of Prostitution and the Museum of Cannabis. You can also find peep shows, sex shops, sex theatres, and strip clubs, among others,” he told me.
Having parted ways with 25 euros and comfortably seated in the very front row for obvious reasons, it was time for a sex show in one of the theatres.
A large curtain stood still and meaningless in front until it snapped open; two naked bodies; a man and a woman started performing on stage.
I could see that they were enjoying the performance as they slowly responded to the songs playing in the background. The more I watched the couple, the more the act felt like watching choreographed dance, as the dancers changed positions to the beat and sound of the music.
Though a few metres away, it was possible to read the absence of life in their eyes. It was typical work, no play. At intervals, while in the act the man would look out into the crowd, leaving one wondering where his mind is at.
As I flashed my phone out of my bag to check the time Perry sternly warned me: “Remember it is strictly forbidden to take pictures or film women behind their windows. That rule also applies here [theatres], in strip clubs and peep shows.”
At the stage, amid some handclapping and screams, the curtain finally closes. The curtain opened again as more performers come onto the stage for what can best be termed as a variety show.
In another startling act, a performer, arguably the most flamboyant of them all, calls for three volunteers onto the stage. She had them dance and then eat a banana out of snatch!."

  Parliament has adopted a motion by Ntchisi North member of Parliament (MP) Boniface Kadzamira (Independent) for government to legalise cultivation and use of industrial hemp in the country.
However, some legislators emphasised the need for government to exercise caution on the issue, fearing some unscrupulous people could take advantage of the legislation to promote the growing of the illicit Indian hemp (marijuana/chamba).
In May last year, Kadzamira asked government to legalise industrial hemp, saying it was a viable alternative to boost the country’s foreign exchange earnings.

This week, Kadzamira moved that both at policy and legislation levels, the hemp should be recognised as an agricultural cash crop for industrial purposes distinct from other cannabis varieties.
He said: “Industrial hemp has been grown in some countries since the 1770s and it has proven a viable cash crop. Malawi needs this legislation to start enjoying the benefits that accrue from the growing and use of industrial hemp.”
Salima Central MP Felix Jumbe (Malawi Congress Party-MCP) said while he agreed with Kadzamira on the economic viability of industrial hemp, government needs to come up with measures to ensure the crop is not confused with the illicit Indian hemp.
He said because of its close relationship with Indian hemp, industrial hemp might easily be abused, in the process promoting the smoking of marijuana.
It was the second time an MP had proposed legalisation of Indian hemp. In April 2000, then deputy minister of Agriculture Joe Manduwa also surprised fellow legislators when he championed the same in Parliament.
In July last year, in the wake of Kadzamira’s proposal, Kemet Forum and other scholars organised a seminar to initiate an intellectual conversation on the issue.
In United States of America (USA), Colorado, Alaska and Washington States have made smoking, growing and owning small amounts of marijuana legal.
In Malawi, Indian hemp is illegal and those found cultivating, possessing or trading the same are arrested and prosecuted in courts of law.
Hardly a month passes without reports of bags and truckloads of impounded Indian hemp from traffickers, some of whom use uncharted routes or public transporter in some cases.
Indian hemp has several uses, including medicine where it has been used for easing pain and inducing sleep or for a soothing influence in nervous disorders, according to www.botanical.com. n"

Music is a powerful tool for social change. It is even more powerful when done by respected and celebrated musicians.
In Malawi, the Black Missionaries Band is, arguably, the most famous band as it attracts huge patronage to its shows.
Black Missionaries
But the band’s repeated reference to chamba smoking during their shows has made some patrons wonder if they endorse use of the illegal stimulant.
For instance, a collaborative Mwala Okanidwa seems to talk about chamba the drug but the group say they talk of chamba the chichewa term for music genre.
The song, with Chizondi and Anjiru Fumulani on vocals, usually marks the climax of the band’s live performances.
The two, in the thick of their act, say the Black Missionaries love chamba without further explanation.
The band then extends the song to a rendition of a childhood song titled Kodi Nonse Mwasamba?
Says the song: “Kodi nonse mwasuta? Ife tasuta, aphunzitsi bwerani muzawone nokha, ngati mupeze wina asanasute muyenera kunchosa samvera lamulo.” [Have you all smoked? We have all smoked. Come teacher and see for yourself. If you discover that one of us has not smoked remove them; they are breaking the law]
The question, thus remains: Is the Black Missionaries not endorsing chamba smoking to the audience, including the youth who hold the reggae outfit in high regard?
In an interview after a performance in Mzuzu on Saturday, Anjiru disputed assertions that the band is encouraging chamba smoking.
“For us, we sing to entertain people. It’s not that we are encouraging chamba smoking. I don’t think people will start smoking because of our song. These are personal choices,” he said.
Anjiru said chamba is illegal in the country and those found in possession need to be prosecuted.
“The police at the event ought to do their job if they see people breaking the law. We are bound by law. So, anyone found in possession of chamba ought to face the law,” he said.
Interestingly, Lucius Banda, who performed during the same event dubbed Night of the Giants, spoke strongly against public smoking.
Banda paused his performance for a minute after noticing some fans smoking chamba near the stage.
He said: “Please don’t smoke here. We need oxygen to sing.”
Other artists who performed include Anthony Makondetsa, Sam Smacks, Ril B, Nepman and Banda’s son, Johnny."

Police in Machinga are keeping in custody Mphatso Mlozolo, 30, for being found in possession of cannabis sativa commonly known as chamba.
In an interview, Machinga Police Station spokesperson Davie Sulumba said on July 23 2017, police at Machinga Roadblock intercepted a minibus driven by Harris Maseya.

Police missions carried out in the dead of night led the law enforcers to intercept 67 bags of chamba, most of which were reportedly headed for Zimbabwe, and to arrest 56 Ethiopians who had entered Malawi with no travel documents.
The police haul happened over the past two days in three separate incidents in Kasungu, Salima and Dedza. In the incidents, the police utilised tip-off and exhibited alertness in a fresh crackdown on the criminal and illegal activities.
Chamba bags confiscated earlier this year
A Zimbabwe-registered truck, AC 8912A, was intercepted in Kasungu, loaded with 56 bags of chamba (weighing 50 kilogrammes [kg] each). Two Zimbabweans and two Malawians are remanded at Lilongwe Police Station after being involved in the purchase and attempts to conceal the chamba on the truck before its return to Zimbabwe.
The Zimbabweans are truck driver Colbert Chisandure, 35, from Harare, and businessperson Nabeti Chiwira, 37, from Mzilikazi District in Bulawayo.
The Malawians are Rodrick Naphitale, 28, of Chimbwi Village, in Traditional Authority (T/A) Khongoni in Lilongwe, and Osman Hassan, 39, of Chipalamawamba Village, T/A Mponda in Mangochi."
