The United States Cannabis Association (USCA) has committed $10 million (about K8.2 billion) to the purchase of industrial hemp, from some 50 licensed cooperatives across the country.
The association is expected to purchase 229,000 metric tonnes of the commodity yearly to be processed for different purposes in the United States.
In an interview, USCA Chief Executive Officer Wezi Ngalamira said the association will be buying cannabis at $80 per kilogramme for flowers and $2 per kilogramme for the grain.

“We are not middlemen but we are here to provide a guaranteed market which will purchase the leaf for processing. When we harvest flowers, we have already started the processing phase; therefore, the country’s industry will also benefit greatly,” Ngalamira said.
Womeecin Mulanje Farmers Limited Treasurer Robisa Inglis said they have been fully equipped with knowledge on cultivation of the crop and hopes to maximise earnings from the same.
“This ready market provided by USCA has increased our confidence to cultivate cannabis in high volumes. At first, we did not know who would buy our crop when we cultivate it but now we are glad that the buyers are ready to buy us at good prices,” Inglis said.

‘Cannabis could fetch K180m/ha’

CHONGWE—We hope that the figures we are getting from other countries will be a benchmark
One of the cannabis buyers, United States Cannabis Association (Usca), has hinted that one hectare of cannabis could fetch up to K180 million from an investment of around K25 million to K30 million on a hectare.
The cannabis buyer said the cost analysis is based on prices sourced from countries such as Lesotho which is doing well with the crop.
Usca Director of Operations Oliver Ndhlovu said, if properly cultivated, farmers could produce around eight to 10 tonnes of cannabis per hectare and get around $5,000 per kilogramme.

Ndhlovu made the remarks on Tuesday in Mzimba District during a land verification exercise of cannabis fields of cooperatives, companies and partnerships who have registered to plant the crop this year.
“We are doing our own analysis as Malawi. We are working with Cannabis Regulatory Authority (CRA), Ministry of Agriculture and Invergro, which is an experienced company dealing with cannabis,” he said.
Figures show that, for one hectare, farmers require K8.8 million for a packet of 20,000 seeds.

On the onset, farmers require cultivation, processing or transportation lincence, police clearance, a greenhouse at the farm, reliable water source, labour and security plan that would prevent access to industrial hemp premises by unauthorised persons.
Meanwhile, some farmers have started raising fears over what they describe as stiff regulations in the cultivation of the leaf.
One of the farmers, Paul Chongwe, who is Chairperson of the United Organic Producers Cooperative, said most farmers were still not aware how much the commodity could be fetching.
The cooperative has 105 members, three farms, with 155 cumulative hectares.
“We are also still looking at what a hectare might bring in terms of rewards. But since the crop is new in Malawi, we hope that the figures we are getting from other countries will be a benchmark for us,” he said.
Malawi legalised cultivation of industrial and medicinal Cannabis Sativa in July 2020 which saw the establishment of CRA to regulate the cannabis industry as provided for in the Cannabis Regulation Act 2020.

Invegrow Limited, a company that was established in 2013 designed to grow and process Industrial Hemp in the country, plans to start commercial growing of the crop this year.
A South Africa based Canadian cannabis investor Graham Macntosh from Green Quest Pharmaceuticals said Malawi is losing out in cannabis trade.
He said Green Quest Pharmaceuticals is looking for 50 000 hectare of land to grow the industrial hemp used in the manufacturing of certain goods including clothes as well as medicine.
“Everyone should be allowed to grow cannabis without any legal impingements from a small one hectare to 101 hectare of land,” he said.
The cannabis investor said industrial hemp can take over tobacco as the largest forex earner, saying tobacco is now facing smoky future whilst cannabis faces bright future in investments.
Macntosh said currently, cannabis is a US$7 billion investment worldwide, saying within a year, it is expected to grow to US$10 billion.
Ntchisi north MP Boniface Kadzamira said although parliament legalized the testing of industrial hemp, which have since been done at Chitedze Research Station in Lilongwe and Chitala in Salima, cannabis remains illegal in Malawi.
He said to push the legalization on fast track, the government can put in regulations to allow people grow industrial hemp and investors get licence to buy the cannabis from Malawian farmers.
While cultivation or selling of cannabis sativa is prohibited by law, government says the industrial hemp will help boost the economy.
Industrial hemp and marijuana are from the same family of crops but industrial hemp does not contain the psychoactive chemical agents found in marijuana.
Meanwhile, Invegrow Limited, a company that was established in 2013 designed to grow and process Industrial Hemp in the country, plans to start commercial growing of the crop this year.
The firm, which has been working with government to research the viability of hemp as a commercial crop, has started mobilising resources for its factory in Lilongwe.
“Industrial hemp has more economic opportunities as we will be extracting the oil for fibre from the seed and produce oil products and it is also edible,” said Director at Invegrow Limited, Nebert Nyirenda, who adds that last year, the company imported body wash, shampoo and face wash with hemp seed oil just to give Malawians a feel of the products from Industrial Hemp.

Kadzamira (c) says only 35 companies satisfied the requirements.
Board chairperson of CRA, Boniface Kadzamila, announced Friday  afternoon in Lilongwe.
Kadzamira said that a total of 41 companies applied but only 35 companies satisfied the requirements.
He said so far, the authority has issued licenses for cultivation, processing and storage and has not yet issued any license for export.
Cannabis production is bringing hope in the economy that it will complement tobacco, the country’s main source of foreign exchange.
Figures show that over a 10-year period, earnings from tobacco have dropped by about 45 percent.
A recent analysis by Invegrow Limited, one of the firms that conducted research on industrial hemp,found that a kilogramme of industrial hemp could fetch about K32 000 on the market and that there is potential for direct annual benefit to Malawians in excess of K3 billion on 16.5 hectares or K195 million per five hectares.
The analysis further indicated that the crop has ready markets whose global value chain is worth about $9 billion (about K6. 6 trillion), giving local investors a basis to take up cannabis production.

Lowe made the remarks on Friday during a cooperatives training workshop for cannabis growers in Traditional Authority Nyoka in Mchinji District.
The minister said cannabis production, if taken seriously, has the potential to help the country in achieving the Malawi 2063 development blueprint, which has a pillar of agriculture commercialization.
Minister of Agriculture, Lobin Lowe : Form coops
He said the plant is regulated unlike other crops like maize and beans; hence, the need for those certified farmers to be equipped with expertise so that they meet International standards.
“The trainings are an opportunity to our co-operatives to be well equipped with high standards of skills to meet international standards because unlike other crop they rely on export markets which are highly competitive, hence for our farmers to be competitive, they need to have highly skilled co-operatives,” said Lowe.
However, he warned Malawians with intentions to grow the crop against rushing before getting a license, stressing that doing so would be contravening the law governing the production of cannabis in Malawi.
In her remarks, the United States Cannabis Association Chief Executive Officer, Wezzi Ngalamira, said his organisation will act as bridge between farmers and already identified buyer.
Ngalamira said the association will come up with a system whereby they are going to buy from different farmers and cooperatives on behalf of the US branch.
On prices, she assured the farmers that they will not be duped as it is with other industries “because government will regulate the prices so that there is a win-win situation between the farmer and the buyer.”
The Cannabis Regulatory Authority (CRA) chairperson Boniface Kadzamira expressed optimism that the country stands to benefit from the certified industrial hemp.
Kadzamira warned unlicensed farmers against growing cannabis
Kadzamira said, so far, they have licensed about 72 both local and international companies.
“Let me warn those that haven’t been licensed not to engage themselves into this farming because doing so is contravening the law of the Cannabis Act. The penalties for non-compliance range from 50 million kwacha and 25 years imprisonment, hence people should not dare to taste the law,” he said.
But Kadzamira disclosed that the government is considering issuing some special licenses to local farmers who may wish to grow local varieties so that Malawians can also benefit from their locally produced variety.
Meanwhile, retired renowned international boxer who after retiring from his boxing career is now into cannabis growing in the US Mike Tyson will be the ambassador of the cannabis across the world.

USCA Malawi reportedly advocates for the growth of a responsible and legitimate cannabis industry in the country.
Wezi Ngalamira talking to journalists and a cross section of the young graduate interns
The association’s Chief Executive Officer, Wezi Ngalamira, told journalists on Monday that the four-day training, which began on Sunday at Lake Malawi Anglican University in Lilongwe, has brought together graduates from Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Mwimba Institute of Agriculture and University of Malawi, among other institutions.
Ngalamira said each graduate intern, after being trained on growing of cannabis, will be attached to a USCA farmer cooperative, where there is a fully fledged automated greenhouse, solar panel, borehole and water tank, among other necessary facilities and technologies.
“After we train them, theoretically and practically, we will deploy them to our cooperatives to train farmers for 16 weeks so they are able to handle those facilities and technologies in order to produce the best crop for their own benefit and national development. So we want the interns to be well equipped for the task,” Ngalamira said.
In his remarks, one of the interns, Daniel Mbaya, commended USCA for organizing the training, saying it will equip him, as an agriculturalist, with additional information in the management of the agriculture field, especially the new value chain of cannabis production.

“Being a new crop, there is less information about it. A lot of farmers are not aware of the production requirements. So this training is vital, for the additional information will assist us in making farmers produce the best crop,” Mbaya said.
Cannabis production is bringing hope in the economy of Malawi and there are high expectations that it will complement tobacco, which is the country’s main source of foreign exchange.
A recent analysis by Invegrow Limited, one of the firms that conducted research on industrial hemp, found that a kilogram of industrial hemp could fetch about MK32 000 and that there is potential for direct annual benefit to Malawians in excess of K3 billion on 16.5 hectares or K195 million per five hectares.

Hemp the woman hid in the baskets
Police Prosecutor Sergeant Getrude Chingolo Kafumbula told the court that the suspect Veronica Mwala was on 1st December last year at Chingeni road block found with two baskets containing Indian hemp weighing 62.5 kilograms which is contrary to regulation 19(1) as read with 4(a) of Dangerous Drug Act.
“The suspect was traveling in a motor vehicle registration number BP 1870 from Nkhotakota heading Blantyre, and upon being searched at Chingeni road block, it was discovered that the baskets that had dried fish on top contained Indian hemp,” Kafumbula told the court.
The suspect pleaded guilty to the offence and upon submission of the facts by the state, the court found her with the case to answer and consequently convicted her.
In her submission before sentence Kafumbula asked the court to consider giving the suspect a stiffer sentence saying that people like Veronica are the ones who are contributing to the bad behavior of the youths.
“Giving such people a stiffer sentence can be one way of protecting our children” Kafumbula said.
In her mitigation, the suspect Veronica Mwala asked for forgiveness saying she was doing this because of poverty and that she has five children to look after. She said the father of the children divorced her and she is the only parent who looks after them.
Passing judgment, Second Grade Magistrate Victor Sibu conquered with the state that people like Veronica are contributing to the bad behavior of the youths.
He said a lot of children are behaving strangely these days because of dangerous drugs like Indian hemp.
The Magistrate  therefore said the suspect deserved a stiffer sentence and then ordered her to pay a fine of K60, 000.00 and in default serve a 2 months custodial sentence.

CRA director general, Ketulo Salipira, said the numbers were few because a majority of those that have been licensed are hoping to depend on rain-fed while others are still setting up their irrigation facilities.
Dr. Ketulo Salipira, Director General, CRA
According to CRA, the four companies currently growing the crop are Mchinji Cannabis Cooperatives, Invegrow Limited, CPG Investments and Women of Vision.
“The licenses have one year lifespan subject to renewal and we expect that within the period, the licensees will have produced the crop as planned.
“The industry is a complicated one and new in this country, we are just setting it up. However, we expect those who have already started producing like Invegrow, they will start exporting between January and February next year when the economy will start benefiting from the industry,” Salipira said.
CRA licensed 48 firms for medicinal cannabis and 35 firms for industrial hemp production while six were licensed for research purposes on the crop varieties.
Farmers Union of Malawi (FUM) chief executive officer, Jacob Nyirongo, said cannabis has emerged as an alternative crop to tobacco, but said there is need for government commitment to ensure that the value chain takes an inclusive process.
“It’s a new crop and there are challenges. The conditions that farmers are supposed to meet in order to grow the crop are quite difficult to meet.
“It requires public investment in terms of extension services, training, advisory services and financing, without this, we will see farmers being excluded,” Nyirongo is quoted as saying in the press.
License fees to cultivate and sell as well as the license to process is pegged at $10 000 (about K7.4 million) for medicinal cannabis and license fees to cultivate and sell industrial hemp is at $2 000 (about K1.4 million).
On the other hand, a license to process industrial hemp is pegged at $5 000 (about K3.7 million).
Other requirements include that farmers should present a business plan to the CRA and should have readily identified markets upon application for production.
Invegrow director, Nebert Nyirenda, said the they have started hemp cultivation under greenhouses to produce flowers for extracts or premium grade flowers for export.
He said their greenhouses occupy nearly 10 000 square meter of space and the factory space of nearly 1 200 square meters which is already completed and connected to 3 phase power and that processing equipment is being procured.
An economic expert, Milward Tobias, has since tipped licensed companies and cooperatives to swiftly work on developing irrigation facilities as cannabis has potential to boost country’s revenue base.

The commercial growing of the hemp crop
The prospective cannabis farmers claim they have invested K30 million in the industrial hemp farming.
M’mbelwa Investment Limited spokesperson Rev. William Mumba said Saturday n Mzuzu that delays to issue licenses are frustrating.
He said the government should issue them with the licences.
“We are extremely concerned as famers because we have invested a lot into this venture. We had all the trust in our government that they would fulfill what was promised because it is about the country’s economy and the economy of individuals. The minimum investment by a single individual is about K700,000.00 while the maximum is 30 million Kwacha.
“It’s very unfortunate that government does not seem to be concerned and this is where we think we might consider mobilizing ourselves to force government to refund the money. If government issued the licences, farmers from Mzimba alone would bring into the country approximately $2 billion. This would certainly help to boost the economy of the country,” explained Mumba.
Another concerned farmer, Martin Kumwenda, wondered why an initiative conceived by government itself was also being hindered by the same government.
“We were asked by the same government to get organized to grow cannabis. We underwent trainings, paid licence fees and got down to prepare land. We are very concerned that government does not bother the time frame that was agreed upon,” lamented Kumwenda.
Last Thursday, agriculture authorities updated farmers that they were waiting for Ministry of Justice to gazzette names of board members by this week.

Rastafarian man smoking cannabis
Cannabis is regarded as a “sacred commodity” by Rastas and they have been campaigning to have laws allow them to use and sell cannabis as part of their religious beliefs and culture.
Dung their routine search on the night of February 4, 2015, police found Pitilizani Lapukeni with the ‘luggage’ aboard a National Bus Company bus registration BQ 4132 going to Blantyre from Mzuzu.
“Soon after the bus arrived at Kaombe Police roadblock, all passengers disembarked for police search. In the process, they discovered five baskets put together and concealed in black plastic paper which contained the illicit drug,” said Nkhotakota Police spokesperson Williams Kaponda.
The weed is widely grown in Nkhotakota.
He added: “A few minutes later the man came to a police officer conducting the search and offered him K4 000 to let him pass with the dangerous drugs. This prompted the officers manning the roadblock to identify the owner of the baskets and was immediately arrested.”
The suspect has been charged with an offence of being found in possession of Cannabis Sativa without license contrary to section 4 (a) of Dangerous Drug Regulation and 19 (1) of the Dangerous Drug Act.
Lapukeni hails from Mbaluku village, Senior Chief Malengachanzi in the district and is expected to appear before Nkhotakota Magistrate Court soon.
Following such growing cases which have become rampant in the district, police have appealed to the general public to come forward with information that will lead to curbing the malpractice.
Police, further remind the general public that rewards are still being made to patriotic Malawians who come forward with information which lead to the arrest of the drug traffickers.
But the Rasta continue to argue that the constitution allows everyone’s entitlement to freedom of  religion, including Rastafarian which allows use of Chamba regarded as a “sacred commodity” and “sacrament incense” with authority for its use derived from the Bible.
They regard Chamba as a herb originally grown in the Garden of Eden for the use of mankind for religious, culinary and medicinal purposes.
And that they don’t sell Chamba in open market as they  do it in their “Rastafarian gatherings” comparing the practise of Christian churches holding summer fairs and coffee mornings for fund raising purposes.

Chamba peddlers in Nkhotakota with their bags containing the ‘golden leaf’
While the Nkhotakota operation was done by the Police and Game Rangers, the Kasungu operation was by the Police and the Courts simply because the latest case was under the courts confinement. In Nkhotakota the drug was found in a farm in a game reserve and was destroyed in the gardens.
Part of the Kasungu consignment was confiscated from Mbiriyakula Maliko and two others at Kalenga Trading Centre in the Area of Traditional Authority Wimbe in the district.
The other was found by the Police at Chisazima and Bua roadblocks.
The owners were however not traced but Malio and his colleagues convicted and fined K50, 000 each by the Kasungu Magistrate Court.
Kasungu Police Public Relations Officer Edwin Kaunda confirmed of the development which comes at a time when Malawi President Peter Mutharika approved the cultivation of industrial hemp.
Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development Allan Chiyembekeza said  the approval is for trial purposes in the country and that the industrial hemp is not the same as much talked about and known Indian hemp.
“Let me point out that industrial hemp is different from the much talked Indian hemp chamba or Cannabis Sativa] that is prohibited. This [industrial] hemp does not contain the psychoactive chemical elements that affect people when smoked even though it is from the same family of crops,” Chiyembekeza said.
Indian hemp legalization debate took a center stage across the country and three months ago the issue was even raised in Parliament for debate, and the minister explained last month that should the trials be successful, the industrial hemp will be another source of foreign exchange earnings.

Soldier convicted
Sub Inspector James Ngupasye Muyira, prosecuting, told the court that cases related to Indian hemp are rampant in the district.
Andrew Mitochi (34) of Kamuzu Barracks in mitigation said he was remorseful.
He went on to ask the court to be lenient when passing the sentence as he was a first offender and a family man.
However, before passing the sentence magistrate Buleya schooled the convict to be exemplary .
“We expect you as the law enforcers to be the exemplary in respecting the laws that you enforce. Hence a stiff punishment is required for you for others to learn a lesson,” Said Buleya.
He went on to sentence Andrew Mitochito pay a fine of K100, 000 or in default serve two year Imprisonment with Hard Labour (IHL).
Mitochi was arrested on Monday 19, this year at Kaombe roadblock when he was travelling from Dwangwa heading to Lilongwe on Dihatsu Mira Salon registration number IT 6496.

The Blantyre senior resident magistrate court this week sentenced Mussa John to eight years imprisonment with hard labour for being found in possession of 78 plastics of chamba weighing 134 kilograms.
Convicted boy
Some lawyers have shown interest to seek a review of a matter probono.
Counsel Alexious Kamangira says he has already met Mussa in his preliminary investigation of the matter before taking it up to the Chief Resident Magistrate in Blantyre.
On the other hand, executive director for the Centre for Human Rights Education, Advice and Assistance (CHREAA), Victor Mhango, said they will meet the convict on Monday on the same cause.
Mhango says they will be responding to a call by some citizens to intervene on the matter, saying a fine or a suspended sentence would have been fair to the suspect being a first offender and considering his age.

Why me? Chamba farmer
Lyton Lunda, 91, his two sons Nervason, 74, and Alufeyo, 61, were arrested Thursday last week at Nthapangwa Lunda Village, T/A Kampingo Sibande in the district.
On Monday, police prosecutor Sergeant Snowden Chimombo told the court that the three were arrested following a tip by one of the members in the village.
“The police uprooted about 300 plants of cannabis which were found in their garden. The hemp was taken to Lunyangwa research station where it was tested and weighed 456 kilograms, including stems, seeds and roots,” Chimombo said.
The Lundas pleaded guilty to the charge of violating regulation 6(1) as read with 19(1) of the Dangerous Drugs Act and were subsequently convicted.
Chimombo said though they were all first offenders and aged, there was need for a stiffer punishment to serve as a lesson to other ganja farmers in the district.
“The convicts are old people who are responsible in society. The first accused is the village headman which means he was supposed to act responsibly and be exemplary to young ones,” he said.
In mitigation, they all pleaded with the court to exercise leniency saying they are aged and responsible for orphans.
They further promised the court never to engage in Marijuana farming again.
In his ruling, First Grade Magistrate George Longwe told the court that the offence is very serious and needed a stiffer penalty.
He, however, said the court considered charging them using section 340 of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Code.
According to the section, for first offenders, before imposing a prison sentence, a court must, by a process of elimination, rule out that a non-custodial sentence is not the proper way of dealing with the offender.
In deciding that question, the section further says the sentencing court may regard the youth, old age, character, home surroundings, health or mental condition of the accused, among other factors.
“The offense is very serious, but these are first offenders, and elderly; the oldest being 91 and the youngest being 61. In addition, they have repented that they will not do it again,” Longwe said.
He, therefore, used section 337(1) of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Code and discharged them on condition that they should not committee any offence within 12 months.

This came after the police at KIA on Thursday also intercepted another package of chamba (Cannabis sativa) weighing 4kg posted from Harare, again, en route to an address in London, UK.
Both the Thursday and Saturday packages were posted through Kenyan Airways flying to the United Kingdom through KIA, according Sgt. Sapulain Chitonde, spokesperson for KIA Police.
The chamba was packaged in form of cakes and wrapped in carbon papers spread with hot pepper outside apparently to kill the drug’s notable smell, according to Chitonde.
But unlike the Thursday package which bore the name, Clayton Hickey, as the one who posted it in Harare and Richard Peterson as the recipient in London, the Saturday package had Mary Jackson, and Paul Jackson, as the sender in Harare and receiver in London respectively.
“We have not yet made any arrest in connection with the chamba packages but we are currently communicating with our counterparts in Zimbabwe to work together in tracing the culprits,” said Chitonde.
Between September and November 2015 KIA handled over 10 similar cases except that the parcels were posted from Blantyre to various destinations in Europe mostly via Ethiopian Airways.
During the same period, Police in Blantyre arrested Nigerian national, Mzee Chidiebere at Blantyre Post Office on suspicions that he was behind the posting of the packages of chamba to Europe.
Importation, exportation, possession or consumption of chamba is illegal in Malawi under Sec. 11 (A) of the Penal Code as read with Regulation 19 of Dangerous Drug Act, according to Chitonde.

Malawi Revenue Authority confiscates 109 bags of chamba
Tom Sangala

The Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) on Sunday evening impounded a vehicle carrying 109 bags of cannabis sativa, popularly known as Chamba, each weighing about 30 kilogrammes at its Lirangwe customs roadblock in Blantyre.
MRA officials estimate the consignment to be worth billions.
Chamba is still illegal in the country and officials at the tax-collecting body have said the van registration ZA 1580 and owned by Chatherm Technologies was on its way to Blantyre from Nkhotakota.

Apparently, the van managed to cross all the roadblocks along the country’s main roads with the consignment.
But officials manning the Lirangwe road block, which checks any goods going in and out of Blantyre City, say they stopped and forced the driver and three other people out of the vehicle upon his reluctance to voluntarily allow the officers to search the vehicle.
They searched the van and noticed that all the 109 bags it was transporting were actually filled with the illegal herb.

The officials at the road block also stated that Police are yet to make any arrest on matter as the driver and the other three escaped as the police were searching the van.
So far Michael Mlenga of Nancholi Township in Blantyre has claimed ownership of the vehicle which is white in colour although its registration documents indicate it is red and is owned by a Mr. B Chawawa.
In an interview later, Deputy Director of Corporate Affairs at MRA, Steven Kapoloma, confirmed the development, saying police are really yet to make any arrests.
“Indeed as MRA we impounded a van which was transporting about 109 bags of chamba to Blantyre, this is part of our mandate as apart from collecting tax we also are under obligation to protect Malawian citizens from hazardous goods and products which may enter the country through our borders,” Kapoloma said.
Meanwhile, Kapoloma has also said MRA has officially handed over the Indian hemp to the police to help with investigations and disposal.
“Our role as MRA ended when we handed over the consignment to the Police to investigate and dispose of the consignment, but still more we will follow through the whole process,” He said.

Chamba convict
The convict with his two bags of Chamba
The soldier Noel Kabango (35), working at the Support Battalion and the gang members were  arrested following a robbery at Chipiku shop in Nkhoma where over K3 million  was stolen last month when they were armed with a rifle from the MDF containing 19 rounds of ammunition.
The soldier and his three accomplices  Jafali Bashiri (20), Mixon Banda (36) and Lyton Magombo (25),  pleaded guilty to taking part in a robbery on August 26 this year and hacked shop manager.
Malawi soldiers have previously appealed for an increase in their salaries, said to be meagre.
But Principal resident magistrate Patrick Chirwa said a soldier and prison officer should have been the last people to engage in crimes considering that they were entrusted with the security of the country.
“Yet, here we have them at the forefront using the skills and training they were entrusted with to terrorise their own beneficiaries. It is a very upsetting situation. For these reasons, I do not think a non-custodial sentence could serve the purpose in sentencing them.
“It is better for them to nurse their remorse while serving a long custodial sentence than for them to be let loose within the shortest period of time when the potential of them regrouping for further crimes is still in sight.”
Chirwa said the offenders deserved more than the recommended 10 years imprisonment because they did not just brandish a dangerous weapon, but they used it to inflict three painful scars on a helpless victim.
Elsewhere
In Dowa, first grade magistrate court has convicted and sentenced Weluzani Singade (35- years) and Kwame Banda (21-years) to 30 and 20 months imprisonment with had labour (IHL) respectively without the option of fine,  for being found in possetion of Indian hemp.
The two convicts comited the offences on different days.
But they were all busted on a road block.
The first case was prosecuted by constable Regina  Kumwenda and the second case was prosecuted by sergeant Triza Kalonjele.
The two prosecutors told the court to give stiffer sentences to deter other would be offenders.
The fisrt grade magistrate Amulan Phiri agreed with the prosecutors for a stiff sentences.
He therefore sentenced them to 30 and 20 months repectively without the option of fine.

0  Driver Noel Banda may have thought he was pulling a fast escape when he crashed through a special road block set up by Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) and police officers near Madisi in Dowa at around 1am last Thursday.
But it took only a few minutes for him to realise that his game was almost over, as the officers jumped into their vehicle and gave chase to his Toyota Dyna van registration BLK 4690.

After a five-kilometre chase, the officers had cornered Banda to a stop. When Banda initially responded that he was carrying stationery from Mzuzu to Lilongwe, the officers expressed reservations even before they inspected the load locked away in the van.
That is how the officers found, and impounded, 68 bags of suspected Indian hemp (chamba). There was no stationery found.
MRA, which sets up such patrols based on intelligence information that illicit goods are transported in the wee hours of the night in certain ‘porous’ areas, handed over the suspected chamba to  Lilongwe Police Station on Monday morning.
Lilongwe Police Station spokesperson Kingsley Dandaula said samples of the haul will be sent to Chitedze Research Station for analysis before a charge can be pressed against Banda, who is being kept at the station’s cells.
Dandaula praised MRA for their innovative special patrols nationwide which he said are helping the Malawi Police Service (MPS) in clamping down on criminal activities.
MRA head of corporate affairs Steve Kapoloma yesterday saluted the police for helping his organisation to put a stop to the movement of illicit goods.
“Our special patrols, which also target border areas where Indian hemp and other drugs may be easily moved in or outside Malawi through uncharted routes, have proved very successful. This latest catch is proof that we need to work harder in securing our roads and our nation,” he said. n",2068-09-10 00:00:00,"driver, read, think, pull, crash, set, take, realise, jump, give, intercept, corner, respond, carry, express, inspect, lock, find, impound, suspect, be, find, set, base, transport, hand, suspect, say, send, press, keep, praise, say, help, clamp, salute, help, put, target, move, prove, need, work, secure, say",five-kilometre

Malawi Police intercept chamba cake

242 Less than a minuteAdvertisement
Malawi Police at Kamuzu International Airport (KIA) in Lilongwe Thursday intercepted Cannabis sativa, locally known as chamba, in cake form, weighing 4 kilogrammes.
According to KIA Police Public Relations Officer (PRO) Sapulain Chitonde, the illegal drug was wrapped in carbon papers covered with pepper “to disguise the smell and beat security.”
“The parcel was posted from Zimbabwe by a Cleyton Hickey, 19, whose address is Oakland Road, Braeside, Harare and it was going to Richard Peterson, 89, of Woodheyes Road, London, using Zimbabwean Post Office on Kenyan Airways from Zimbabwe through Malawi to the UK,” said Chitonde.

He added that KIA Police have stepped up security at the airport especially when it comes to scrutinising every parcel that enters or leaves the airport, hence the interception of the illicit drug.
The KIA Police PRO said no arrest has been made so far because the parcel was sent from Zimbabwe.
“We will communicate with our colleagues in Zimbabwe so that they can trace the sender using the name and address that we have,” said Chitonde.

Illegal importation of dangerous drugs is contrary to section 11 as read with regulation 19 of the Dangerous Drugs Act.
KIA Police have in the past intercepted a number of illegal exports and imports which include the lucrative but banned game trophies popularly known as ivory and round wood.

Belewa: Why me?
Police Prosecutor Sergeant Christopher Nyirongo told the court that the suspects Boniface Brasho 23, Gift Banda 37, George Biliwita 22, Memory Banda 23 and Mayeso Misomali 30 were found with over 700 kilograms of the illegal herb on 6th April, 2016 within Balaka town.
“The suspects were traveling in motor vehicles Toyota Noah registration number NU 5035 and a Toyota Corolla registration number KA 4516 from Nkhotakota heading Zomba, and were intercepted within Balaka Town after the Police erected an abrupt road block,” he said.
The suspects pleaded guilty to the offence of being found in possession of Indian hemp and upon submission of the facts by the state.
Nyirongo asked the court to consider giving the suspects a stiffer sentence considering that “the suspect are not first offenders” as they were also convicted by the Salima Magistrate Court on the similar charge.
He said this shows that they are not changing hence the need for a stiffer sentence.
In their mitigation, the suspects pleaded for forgiveness saying they were doing this because of poverty and that they have children to look after.
Passing judgment, First Grade Magistrate Felix Mandala said the suspects deserved stiffer sentences and then ordered Boniface Brasho and George Biriweti to pay a fine of K60, 000.00 each and in default serve a 6 months custodial sentence.
The Magistrate also ordered Gift Banda, Memory Banda and Mayeso Misomali to pay a fine of K30, 000.00 each and in default serve a 3 months custodial sentence.
Mandala said he has given them such a sentence so that it should be lesson to them and would be offenders. The court has also ordered that the cannabis sativa be destroyed.
All the suspects paid the fines.
In a related development Police in Dowa this week arrested a 44-year-old man on suspicion that he was cultivating Indian hemp.
Dowa Police spokesperson Richard Kaponda identified  the suspecr as Luka Belewa.
He said police also uprooted the plant grown on about half an acre.
Kaponda said the suspect comes from Mtengowopota Village, Traditional Authority (T/A) Msakambewa in the district.

0  Nkhotakota Forestry Department on Saturday made a surprise raid in Dwambazi Forest Reserve where they destroyed Indian hemp and other crops planted by encroachers.
Similar attempts to drive out the encroaching communities, particularly from traditional authorities Kanyenda and Kafuzira, have proven futile as encroachers continue breaking new ground.
A forestry officer slashes chamba and beans
The operation, jointly conducted with armed game rangers from African Parks which is managing Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve under a 20 year-long concession in a public private partnership arrangement, saw hundreds of hectares of Indian hemp, commonly called chamba, being destroyed while other crops such as beans, soya beans and maize were also slashed down.
In an interview after the exercise, district forestry officer George Ziphophe said he is not happy with the rate at which the forest is fast being turned into a hotspot for chamba cultivation.
He said the forest is being targeted for cultivation because of its fertile soils.
“There are a number of factors that compel these people to encroach into the forest. One such factor is fertility. The soils are very rich in mineral salts, hence, they do cultivate without fertiliser.
“Additionally, the moisture content is good such that they do farm in summer. But we cannot condone such illegal practice to prevail. We will take them head on,” he said.
According to a 2009 Nkhotakota District Social Profile, the 36 600 hectare forest reserve, which was gazetted in 1996, had 145 encroaching households that occupied about 283 hectares.

Chamba peddlers in with their bags containing the ‘golden leaf’
Chief Resident Magistrate, Thomson Ligowe jailed Jambo Jambo, 42, and his accomplice Boniface Chinthenga 40 years old after they pleaded not guilty to the charge of being found in possession of Cannabis Sativa contrary to Section 4 (a) of the Dangerous Drugs Regulations and 19 (1) of Dangerous Drugs Act.
Police prosecutor, Superintendent Moja Phiri told the court that the two were arrested by the police who mounted an adhoc roadblock at Green Corner along Chikwawa road in Blantyre.
Jambo was arrested on 23rd December, 2015 while his accomplice- who had escaped- was arrested a day later.
Phiri disclosed that 40 bags of Chamba were recovered from a lorry and a minibus the two were using to ferry the illegal substance.
The Indian hemp, the court was told, was firstly packed in the minibus driven by Chinthenga before being transferred to into the lorry driven by Jambo which had carried maize husks to be delivered in Nsanje district.
Chinthenga had managed to escape but was later on traced and arrested.
Magistrate Ligowe convicted the two after four witnesses testified against them including Doctor Moses Munthali, an analyst from Bvumbwe Research Station.
Jambo hails from Jambo village, T/A Mbenje in Nsanje while Chinthenga
comes from Ndalama village, T/A Chikowi in Zomba district.
Cultivating or selling of Indian hemp is illegal in Malawi though currently government is doing trials on industrial hemp as one of the strategies to boost the country’s ailing economy.

0Growing, using, or possessing marijuana is illegal in Malawi. But it appears both production and sales are rising.
The growth in sales means that growers cultivating the drug are motivated by large profits they gain from its sales.
A pregnant woman blows a blunt at Matafale Memorial
The production and selling of chamba has been increasing in the country over the years.
However, it is arguably premature to ascertain if efforts to curb its production are also on the increase.
In 2010 alone, the Malawi Police Service confiscated about 70 000 kilogrammes of the illicit drug.
According to the United Nations figures on number of chamba seizures in Malawi from 1995 to 2000 published in the 2003 Institute for Security Studies Report, 403 500 kilogrammes of cannabis was impounded.
The availability of ‘weed’ has reached an alarming rate in the country.
And this is evident in public spheres.
At almost every secular music show, revellers party with either chamba or smoke emanating from it.
Merchants openly selling chamba at the Matafale Memorial in Chileka, Blantyre last year
Men and women are publicly seen selling the product, even luring customers by capitalising on the perceived benefits of chamba.
All this happens in full view of police officers, who are there to ensure security at the shows. Yet, this hallucinogenic variant is banned in Malawi.
In 2000, the Rastafari
community in Malawi went to court to demand the right to smoke marijuana.
This subsequently resulted in government briefly exploring the possible legalisation of Indian hemp, despite police warnings of potential abuse by cannabis growers.
This was championed in Parliament by the then Deputy Minister of Agriculture Joe Manduwa, who argued that the plant could be a valuable alternative to tobacco.
The idea was supported by a number of MPs, but it never saw the light of day, meaning chamba remains illegal in Malawi.
Malawi Police Service press and public relations officer, Rhoda Manjolo, says the responsibility of providing security is for everyone in the country.
“People need to be proactive in terms of security and not wait for the police to always act. It is high time we start taking a collective measure. There are a lot of people who have been arrested for being found in possession of chamba, for instance.
“Talking about chamba smoking or selling at musical shows, there are a lot of people at such events as compared to the number of police officers, who are evidently busy with other equally important things,” she says.
Manjolo explains that sometimes the police miss out on certain things happening at the event.
“Again, police feel that arresting people at such places is disturbing the freedom and enjoyable environment for people,” she explains.
On their part, Musicians Union of Malawi (MUM) says police are to blame for the proliferation of chamba, even in townships where youths are openly puffing on the blunt.
“Some police personel do not go to musical shows to work, but to enjoy with the people; hence, they forget their number one responsibility: security. The police are to blame because they are mandated by law to control any kind of misbehaviour.
“As MUM, we have agreed that no one should be seen smoking chamba in public and check around, many musicians are respecting that. It’s the fans and the police that are misbehaving,” argues the union’s president Reverend Chimwemwe Mhango.
Clinical psychologist Chiwoza Bandawe contends the police are not assuming their key responsibility of enforcing law and order.
“People are motivated by profit and are attracted to where there are customers. A social event is attractive to such persons. Therefore; people take advantage of social events like musical gigs to do things like the sell or smoking of chamba.
“However, this demonstrates that the enforcement agencies are not actively enforcing the law. The society is also watching without approaching such people and asking to smoke elsewhere or to stop,” he states.
According to Bandawe, marijuana is a harmful substance whose main chemical ingredient is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is a fatty substance that remains in the body for up to three months after smoking.
It is associated with mental health problems in particular cannabis induced psychosis due to damage to the brain cells that THC causes.

Spokesperson for KIA Police, Sgt. Sapulain Chitonde, told Mana that the chamba was disguised as cakes and wrapped in carbon papers, which were covered with hot pepper apparently in an attempt to kill the smell.
“The parcel was en route to UK with a London address as its destination, and a Harare address as where it was posted from,” explained Chitonde.
He said the authorities were yet to chart the next step regarding the parcel which had since been seized.
This is the first chamba (Cannabis sativa) interception at KIA in the year but more similar cases were reported at the airport between August and November in 2015.
During the period, police in Blantyre arrested a Nigerian known as Mzee Chidiebere on allegations that he was behind the posting of some such parcels from Blantyre to Europe via KIA.
Importation, exportation, possession or consumption of chamba is illegal in Malawi under Sec. 11 (A) of the Penal Code as read with Regulation 19 of Dangerous Drug Act, according to Chitonde.-Mana

Among the suspect’s were Felix Maulidi (35) and January Jafali Phiri (30) who are co-accused of found with 26 bags of the illicit drug loaded in 90 and 50 kilograms sacks.
Nkhotakota police station criminal investigation officer (SCIO), assistant superintendant Cosmas Kadzandira told Nyasa Times: “Working on a tip, on the night of Monday August 31, 2015, we ambushed the house of Felix Maulidi at Mchambwe village, just few metres before Lake Malawi.
“Later upon search, we found 26 bags of hemp of which nine were loaded in sacks covered with mosquito nets. We arrested Maulidi.”
He said during questioning, Mualidi confessed that he is not the owner but January Phiri who came in the night and coaxed him to keep the illicit drug.
But before making a move to arrest Phiri two drug traffickers Steven Phiri (30) and Chilizani Mwenda (20) unknowingly passed by police at the scene. During the time, police did not use police motor vehicle. When stopped and asked what was in their bags one voluntarily revealed that they have carried the dangerous drug and were immediately arrested.

0It took officers from the Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) to impound a truckload of 109 bags of Indian hemp (chamba) at Lirangwe roadblock in Blantyre north in January 2016.
The drugs—which presumably originated from Nkhotakota—were destined for Blantyre city and only the timely interception of the tax officers put a stop to a huge consignment that had eluded officers at a number of police checkpoints in between the two areas—which are almost 400km apart.

Southern Region police spokesperson James Kadadzera expressed surprise at the efficiency with which the syndicate transporting the drug had managed to elude several police checkpoints until it was stopped by an unlikely agency.
Questions have been asked regarding the effectiveness of police roadblocks in the wake of high profile breaches where huge volumes of the illicit drug—which is mainly produced in Nkhotakota and Mzimba—has found  its way into the country’s major cities, causing both security and health concerns.
But amid questions over the law enforcers’ ability to nip drug trafficking in the bud, Malawi Police Service national spokesperson Nicholas Gondwa has backed police officers for their diligence and alertness, but he blamed the country’s road network as the chief cause for such lapses.
“We are doing everything in our powers to stop drug cartels from trafficking chamba into towns and cities. Unfortunately, our efforts are being hampered by the country’s road network. There are a lot of unchartered routes from Nkhotakota to Zalewa routes which these people use. Normally they get caught closer to Blantyre where their options are few and far between,” he said in a telephone interview on Monday.
Gondwa said police had information that drug peddlers branch off into earth roads before Sharpe Valley in Ntcheu and use roads that skirt the mountains all the way to Mtonda—beating three roadblocks at Sharpe Valley, Salima turn off and Chingeni.
He, however, insisted that the police are containing the situation through mounting ad hoc roadblocks on the country’s roads.
“People should know that those roadblocks are mounted based on intelligence. Currently, all police station management officers have been encouraged to use this method and it has been very effective in dealing with crime,” Gondwa said.
While acknowledging the strides the police are making in arresting chamba traffickers, executive director for Drug Fight Malawi, Nelson Zakeyu, blamed the opening of new markets for chamba.
“We appreciate that the police are doing their part under difficult circumstances. They do not have enough resources in terms of equipment and personnel.
“But we have seen an escalation of drug trafficking especially chamba of late. We believe the influx of foreign artists who drum up support for its legalisation is creating a bigger demand for hemp in the country.
“This is dangerous especially to people under the age of 21 who might have their brains permanently damaged when they take the drug,” he said.
Some stakeholders, such as ministries of Home Affairs, Health and Education and civil society organisations, have raised concerns over the escalation in the uptake of illicit drugs by young people in the country. The police have been held responsible for the failure to get things under control.
Martha Savala, a parent from Traditional Authority Khombedza’s area in Salima, said it is high time the government put up serious measures to deal with the chamba network.
“It is always mind-boggling that the police always want to arrest the situation at the end of the distribution chain. No wonder they are failing to control the trafficking of chamba. In fact they should have addressed the problem from the source by blocking production. They [police] know exactly where chamba is produced, how come they do not arrest the growers?” she queried.
While Gondwa blamed the country’s road network for the proliferation of chamba traffickers escaping the police dragnet CaananNyirenda, a transporter based in Mzuzu, said the law enforcers should find another excuse.
“It is not easy for chamba traffickers to use side routes to escape from drug enforcement agencies as it is being claimed. One only has to look at the country’s state of roads to realise that it is quite a tall order for those that transport chamba to divert to unchartered routes. The police needs to tighten the screws within its establishment to ensure corruption among officers manning roadblocks is eliminated,” said Nyirenda.
According to Maziko Matemba, executive director at Health Rights and Education Programme, the question of infiltration in the police rank and file should be a priority area the law enforcers have to work on.
“The health challenges that chamba causes are so enormous and they eat up a portion of the country’s health budget. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the government to stop being defensive and start addressing the problem by increasing drug enforcement efforts. They do not have to leave this job to police alone, different agencies such as the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) should also be roped in,” he said.
But commenting on why there is a veil of secrecy when disposing off of large consignments of chamba which has already been used as evidence by the courts, Gondwa said the laws of the country are used to determine how this should be done.
“Whenever the courts have used the drug as evidence they release it to be destroyed and the police, Judiciary and the Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services all witness this exercise. That is what the law demands. Nowadays, whenever possible, we invite the media to be part of the team but that is not mandatory. All the hemp is destroyed when released by the courts,” he said.

158,https://www.nyasatimes.com/high-court-to-review-mussas-sentence-on-indian-hemp-possession/,www.nyasatimes.com,hemp,"High Court to review Mussa’s sentence on Indian Hemp possessionJuly 12, 2022 Duncan Mlanjira - Nyasa Times Be the first to commentThe case of Mussa John, who was convicted to a mandatory custodial sentence of 8 years by the Senior Resident Magistrate Court, is set to be reviewed tomorrow, June 12 by the High Court but as a 17-year-old offender, not 19 as heard in lower court.
Now legally represented by Alexius Kamangira of Nicholls & Brookes alongside Chikondi Chijozi, Ruth Kaima, and Luntha Chimbwete of Southern Africa Litigation Centre and the Centre for Human Rights, Education Advice and Assistance, the lawyers have discovered that John was wrongly charged as a 19-year-old and they will argue that he is 17 years old — thus he should have been accorded the protection of a child under the Child Care Protection and Justice Act.
Mussa’s case to be reviewed
The notice from the High Court records that On June, 15 2022, Mussa John “was allegedly found with 78 plastic bags (weighing about 134 kilograms) of Indian Hemp at his home and charged with being found in possession of Indian Hemp without a licence — contrary to Regulation 4(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Regulations, as read with Section 19(1) of the Dangerous Drugs Act”.
“The offence of possession of Indian Hemp without a license attracts a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. When the Applicant appeared before the Magistrate’s Court, he was unrepresented, and he pleaded guilty to the offence.”
On behalf of John, the lawyers will argue in the High Court that the 8-year conviction be quashed and set aside his sentence.
The lawyers will also argue that “the Magistrate Court erred in accepting his guilty plea in circumstances where it contradicted his caution statement which indicated that he was not in possession of the Indian Hemp”.
The lawyers “will also argue that his right to a fair trial was violated as he was not provided with a legal practitioner considering the seriousness of the offence that he was charged with”.
The notice observes that the lower court record indicates that John is 19 years old, but he will argue that he is 17 years old and “even though the issue of his actual age was not presented before the lower court, he will argue that the lower court should have invoked the provisions of section 138 of the Child Care Protection and Justice Act which allows for extension of application of the Act to young persons over the age of 18”.
“He will further argue that the charge sheet was defective and that the sentence imposed by the lower court is excessive considering his age and the sentencing trends for the offence.”
The review is in the wake of a decision made by acting Chief Resident Magistrate (South), Chisomo Msokera, who found not defective teenager, Mussa John’s 8-year custodial sentence but had advised for the review of the case.
Dated June 27, 2022 under the subject ‘Confirmation and Supervisory Review of Sentencing in Rep. v John (criminal case number 475 of 2022) and Rep. v Milhade and another criminal case number 567 of 2022’), Msokera took cognizance of the hot debate that ensued soon after John’s conviction.
The hot debate was awash on social media in comparison to the sentence meted on Herve Milhade, Castel Malawi’s managing director — who was also found that he was cultivating the same illegal hemp but was just fined.
“The social media is awash with debates on the propriety of an 8 years imprisonment sentence imposed on a 19-year-old convict on a charge of possession of cannabis sativa.
“There have been questions on whether the punishment meets the demands of distributive justice since retributive sentence appears, as some claimed, off tangent some of the sentencing trends by the magistracy where fines and not custodial sentences have generally imposed.
“One of such cited cases is Rep. v Milhade and another criminal case number 567 of 2022 where the convicts were sentenced to pay a fine of K1 million and in default to serve custodial sentence of 12 months on a charge of cultivating cannabis sativa.”
Msokera observed that the case of the teenager was heard in chambers of the Senior Resident Magistrate Court because there is no designated court room space at Limbe Magistrate Court but the chambers were used as open court.
“The charge is defective as it cites a wrong punishment provision and does not cite the statute book where the offence is provided for. Section 19(1)(a) and not section 16 of the Dangerous Drugs Act is the appropriate punishment provision; and the offence is created under the Dangerous Drugs Regulations.
“The Judgement on Sentence gives reasons as to why, not withstanding the dictates of Section 340 of the Criminal Procedures and Evidence Code, the convict deserves an outright custodial sentences.”
“Msokera also observed that “the Judgement on Sentence took into consideration the mitigating circumstances of the convict being a young person” and that “other than the irregular charge, this was a proper matter which should be forwarded to a superior court strictly for proceedings of review on confirmation under section 15 of the Criminal Procedures and Evidence Code”.
“Other than what I have specifically highlighted herein, the rest of the proceedings — as far as the court record is concerned — does not strike me as defective.
“In view of the cited irregularity and considering the perceive injustice of the sentence as it relates to Milhade and another, Msokera thus invokes section 26(1) of the Courts Act in asking for a “superior court to exercise its supervisory powers in addition to the review on confirmation proceedings over both matters”.
“It is my hope that the process of supervision and review on the confirmation by the High Court shall enrich our sentencing jurisprudence to aid the courts of magistrates in meting our appropriate sentences in cases of this nature.”

‘Indian hemp cultivation not rampant in Nkhotakota’

Malawi police in Dwangwa have said cultivation of Indian hemp in Nkhotakota is not as serious as people allege but the district is only used as a route for traffickers.
When asked to comment on the severity of Indian hemp cultivation in the Central Region district, Nkhunga Police Station spokesperson Austin Kaunda said Mzimba is the main producer and supplier of Indian hemp not Nkhotakota.
“We have records that many traffickers are not from Nkhotakota but from other districts like Blantyre, Lilongwe, Mangochi, Balaka and Salima who pass through from Mzimba where they buy the hemp.

“So, what I can say is that the problem is serious in terms of trafficking because Nkhotakota is used as a route,” he said.
Kaunda also said this year alone police have confiscated 5,238 kilogrammes of Indian hemp following the arrests of 13 traffickers.
The figure is much higher compared to 509 kilogrammes of marijuana police confiscated the whole of last year after arresting 24 people.

The police publicist commended the good working relationship between police and the public.
“We arrest traffickers because of tips from members of the general public and we ask them to continue giving us information,” Kaunda said.
He further said police are aware that small numbers of people are still cultivating the illicit drug in Nkhotakota’s northern part along Lupachi River which borders Mzimba.
“We have had operations to uproot hemp in the past. In 2011 we carried out a joint operation with fellow officers from headquarters where we uprooted about four acres of Indian hemp along Lupachi River. Plans are there to carry out another operation but we are failing due to financial constraints,” said Kaunda.
Soaring number of cases of people caught trafficking Indian hemp from Nkhotakota prompted people to conclude that the district is the country’s largest grower of Indian hemp.

MRA spokesperson, Steve Kapoloma has confirmed the incident which happened in Blantyre where the MRA officials managed to intercept 146 bags of Indian Hemp following a speed chase of a 5-tonne Isuzu lorry.
Kapoloma said the lorry, belonging to Frederick John Chiuja from Mangochi, had passed through the MRA roadblock at Lirangwe without stopping for inspection.
He said this raised suspicion and prompted a speed chase of the lorry by MRA officers who were accompanied by Police Officers.
“The lorry then turned into a dirt road towards Machinjiri and our officers and the Police continued the chase.
“The Police then fired into the air and that is when they abandoned the lorry,” he said.
Kapoloma said the team called for assistance and upon inspection of the lorry, they found 146 bags of Indian Hemp.
He said the Authority has handed over the Indian Hemp to South Lunzu Police Station who have since delivered the illicit drug to Ndirande Police Station.
“This is not the first time for MRA to intercept Indian Hemp.
“Apart from collecting revenue, it is also our mandate to protect Malawians from the importation of prohibited goods which pose a health risk,” Kapoloma said.
He said the state will prosecute the perpetrators.

Renewed calls for hemp cultivation

By Rebecca Chimjeka:
Foreign nationals have started visiting the country on fact-finding missions related to the cultivation of Indian hemp for industrial purposes.
In 2015, President Peter Mutharika gave Invegrow Hemp Power Malawi the nod to embark on industrial hemp cultivation on trial basis.

And, on the international scene, the government of Canada recently legalised the cultivation of Indian hemp for medical use.
Speaking after meeting a group of foreign nationals that is interested in investing in the country, Ntchisi North Member of Parliament (MP), Boniface Kadzamira, asked the government to consider legalising cultivation of all types of hemp in the country.
Kadzamira said investors are ready to invest in 50,000 thousand hectares of both industrial and some hemp verities that are cultivated for medical purposes.

“The country has all it can to grow hemp for both medical and industrial purposes. The government should emulate what some African countries are doing by putting some guidelines on the cultivation of such types of hemp,” Kadzamira said.
The call comes four years after the MP moved a motion in Parliament that would pave the way for cultivation of industrial hemp for trial purposes.
Graham Mackintosh, spokesperson for Green Quest Farmarceuticals, whose company is searching for 50,000 hectares in Africa, said Indian hemp is on high demand in Europe.
“It’s high time the Malawi government considered legalising the type of hemp that World Health Organisation has approved to shore up foreign exchange earnings as well as support the national export strategy and priority sectors of the government,” Mackintosh said.
But Secretary for Agriculture, Grey Nyandule Phiri, said cultivation of the crop is prohibited.

Nkhotakota Police Spokesperson Williams Kaponda said the arrest occurred on Saturday. He identified the soldiers as Grey Chimbulumata, 26, from Parachute Battalion and Mike Jusab, 25, from Mafco Barracks.
“The hemp traffickers came at Kaombe Police Roadblock with an intention to find a lift to Salima. While there, police got suspicious of their movements which prompted the police to search in their travelling bags.
“Following the search, it was discovered that their travelling bags contained the illicit drug and police instantly arrested the two,” he said.
Chimbulumata, 26, hails from Mponela village, T/A Kamwana in Dowa while Mike Jusab, 25, hails from Jemusani Village, T/A Kapeni in Blantyre.

In a related development, police in Nkhotakota have arrested three women for the same offence.
Kaponda said the three who were travelling from Dwangwa to Ntcheu got arrested on Friday, at Kaombe Police Roadblock after a massive search in the motor vehicle they were traveling in.
He said the three who boarded a Toyota Passo registration number IT 2400 driven by Emmanuel Chiwaya had several travelling bags which contained the illicit drug totaling to 32 kilograms.
“When the motor vehicle stopped at the roadblock for a search, it later transpired that the travelling bags contained Indian hemp.
“Chiwaya who was in transit from Tanzania to Blantyre told the police that the travelling bags belonged to the three women who boarded his motor vehicle at Dwangwa. The three women failed to produce a licence and the police immediately arrested them,” Kaponda said.
The suspects include Milliam Chafera, 30, Cecelia Nkolimbo 20 and Maria Winstone, 22, all from Mphandazaola Village, T/A Makwangwala in Ntcheu.

On the saddle: Pigeon peas, not hemp, is what can help Malawi
Tom Sangala
June 21, 2016
289 2 minutes readAdvertisement
There is currently a lot of excitement in Malawi about prospects of industrial hemp as a commercial and export crop for the country. The Ministry of Agriculture is currently running trial production of the crop at Chitedze Research Station in Lilongwe while Parliament last week approved a private member’s bill supporting legalisation of the crop.
Indeed Malawi requires a variety of crops that can provide opportunities for commercial farming and exports on a large scale and earn the country the much needed foreign exchange. And industrial hemp can be one of them.
What is misleading, however, are assertions that once Malawi starts cultivating industrial hemp, all its economic problems will be over. The belief that industrial hemp could bring economic miracles to Malawi is grossly an illusion.

While no single crop would ever replace tobacco as Malawi’s main commercial and export crop, pigeon peas actually has a bigger potential to become a bigger export crop for the country than industrial hemp.
The claims by hemp activists are often exaggerated. Industrial hemp is indeed a useful and highly versatile crop. But its utility is, for the most part, fairly marginal, at least going by existing markets and estimates around the world.
Demand for hemp isn’t as high as proponents would have it. In Europe, demand has been on the decline for several years as buyers have increasingly opted for cheaper or better alternatives—mostly artificial fibres, for many applications.

In the Unites States, imports of hemp-based products — many of them from China — have been legal since 1998. But the total retail market for hemp in the United States is only about $500 million and the market is widely not expected to grow much further.
Even the US Department of Agriculture believes the market potential for hemp will remain small “like those for sesame and poppy seeds.”
Hemp is therefore not the trillion-dollar crop that could finally allow Malawians grow money on trees. And it will take some time and a lot of work for the regulatory environmental and market structures to facilitate proper handling of the crop.
On the other hand, Malawi already grows a number of crops that have huge potential on the export market and only require a little more organisation and motivation for the farmer. Pigeon pea is one of such crops.
The production of this crop is largely concentrated around the Indian subcontinent and east Africa, with Malawi currently rated as the largest producer in Africa while Tanzania is the largest exporter on the continent.
According to the India Pulses and Grain Association, however, most of the pigeon peas exported by Tanzania are from Malawi and this is because of Malawi’s failure to control informal exports across its borders.
With consumers become increasingly conscious about nutrition and concerns about animal-proteins emerging, legumes such as pigeon peas are gaining importance in healthy food habits. This is making the market for legumes like pigeon peas wider.
According to Food and Agriculture Organisation, production of pigeon peas has been on an upward trend over the past decade, with India as the largest producer at 70 percent of global production followed by Myanmar, producing more than 20 percent of global production. Africa accounts for the majority of the remaining production, with Malawi leading at 6 percent of global production, Kenya and Uganda at two percent each while Tanzania accounts only for 0.8 percent of global production.
The largest market for pigeon peas is also in India where demand is also increasing, although the area under cultivation and the yields have remained stagnant, with some downtrend shown in recent years.
India now imports pigeon peas from Africa and Myanmar, with estimates showing that the country requires 500,000 metric tonnes of imports annually to satisfy its domestic requirements.
Although it is not one of the major producers, Tanzania is Africa biggest exporter of pigeon peas to India and its varieties are considered the best in India.
Shockingly though is the fact most of the pigeon peas from Tanzania is actually from Malawi which is also considered another good source of pigeon peas into India, with annual shipments estimated at between 50,000 and 100,000 metric tonnes.
Malawi can therefore easily become a major producer and exporter of pigeon peas if authorities only found ways of formalising exports while working with farmers to increase production and yields. On the other hand, it will take ages for Industrial Hemp to reach the potential pigeon peas already offers to Malawi.

Police in Chileka Blantyre destroyed 109 bags of cannabis sativa popularly known as Chamba each weighing about 30 kilogrammes.
The bags were in a vehicle registration number ZA 1580 which was impounded by the Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) at Lirangwe customs roadblock in Blantyre in January this year.
The vehicle was on its way to Blantyre from Nkhotakota.

In an interview when the police burnt the consignment at Machinjiri Township on Saturday, Chileka Police spokesperson, Grace Mwale, said people who were caught with the consignment are still at large after they bolted when MRA officials intercepted them.
“So far our investigations have not revealed the real owner [of the hemp] but the van which was used to transport the consignment has been handed over to the owner as there is no link between the owner and the consignment,” said Mwale.
She also said the consignment has been burnt following tests conducted at Bvumbwe Research Station proved it was indeed chamba.

“As police, there is really nothing else we can do at this stage apart from burning it because both the driver and his assistant are still at large since escaping from the hands of authorities at Lirangwe road block early this year,” he said.
Malawi Revenue Authority had earlier on handed over the consignment to Police for investigations and disposal.

Police say the operation was jointly carried out by police, villagers from Bamba and parks, wildlife and game reserve rangers from the district, who discovered the farm while officials from the courts, district council and faith leaders were witnesses.
Nkhotakota Police Station spokesperson Williams Kaponda said on Wednesday, the three-acre farm was situated along the banks of Likowa River, which borders Senior Chief Mwadzama and Traditional Authority (T/A) Mwansambo’s areas.
He said the exercise, which is a major breakthrough in the war against chamba cultivation, came a few days after the discovery of the farm by the parks and wildlife officials, who reported the matter to police.
Kaponda said so far, noone has been arrested in connection with the cultivation of the Indian hemp, which were burnt using 120 litres of petrol and 150 litres of diesel.
Meanwhile, the police spokesperson said they were yet to uproot and destroy other Indian hemp plantations discovered at Mwalawamphasa and Kanjedza villages.

This development brings to 201 the number of bags of Indian hemp the Police at Nkhunga have impounded in October alone.
“This is the biggest load to be impounded and as Police we feel our drive to fight drug trafficking and crime in the country is bearing fruits,” Nkhunga Police Station Public relations Officer Labani Makalani said in a statement made available to Nyasa Times on Tuesday.
According to Makalani the 111 bags were confiscated during the night of 29th to 30th October, 2012 when Police received a tip off that some men wanted to traffic the substance from Dwangwa to Blantyre.

“Following this information, a team of Police Officers led by Operations Officer Assistant Superintendant Robert Twalibu mounted an impromptu check point at a certain place along the Dwangwa to Nkhotakota M5 tarmac road.
“At about midnight, they impounded a 10 tonne truck, registration number TO 3825 belonging to W.L. trucking of Thyolo district but the driver and all the occupants managed top escape,” Makalani said.
He said a moment later two men pulled to the scene whilst driving a Toyota vista saloon bearing a Zambian registration number AAQ 5223.
“They told the Officers that they were the owners of the bags and offered bribes to let the truck free but the officers turned down the offer. The Officers then arrested the alleged traffickers,” the Police Publicist said.
The alleged traffickers have been identified as Ali Alan Abdu, aged 42, of Makanjira village, Traditional Authority Katuri in Mangochi district and Harrison Banda, aged 23 years, of Saluti village, Traditional Authority khosolo in Mzimba district.
Police have since charged the duo with Being Found in Possession of Hemp Indian without License under regulation 4A of the Dangerous Drug Regulation as read with section 19(1) of the Dangerous Drug Act.

0Invegrow Limited, a company behind industrial hemp research and production, says it plans to invest $15 million (about K11 billion) in the first three years of its commercial production of industrial hemp-related products.
a researcher showcases products made from industrial hemp
This comes against the backdrop of the company investing $1 million (K738 million) to establish a factory to be commissioned in June this year.
The factory is located at Kasiya in Lilongwe, which is 20 kilometres from the city of Lilongwe and it is expected to be producing on pilot phase hemp oil for human consumption and industrial use.
Invegrow Limited director Nebert Nyirenda said in an interview that factory equipment was already imported and installation plans are advancing well.
He said the major bottleneck is the pending power connectivity by Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi (Escom) which may delay installation of the factory machines, adding that all other activities are on course.
Said Nyirenda: “Commencement of the production is much dependent on how Escom will quickly connect us to the power grid. Our plan is that we should commission the factory atest by June this year.
“Even if the licensing for production of products may delay; we can go ahead to commission the factory because it is a generic equipment that can be used to process any type of vegetable oil.”
He said industrial oil is used as an ingredient into other industrial products.
In terms of investment, Nyirenda said after investing $1 million (about K738 million) in the first phase of production and the market responds well, they will go full commercial and embark on phase two with a total investment between $10 to $15 million.
He said apart from the local market, the company is also targeting the export markets.
“We know that hemp value chain is worth about $9 billion dollars world over so that is the basis of our markets. The markets are there, the $9 billion dollar is there as a full cake and we want to eat part of that cake of the $9 billion dollar industry.
“We have markets in Europe, we have markets in southern Africa, we have markets in European Union, we have markets in America and in China so the market is big just as good as tobacco that is where we want to take a bit of our businesses pie,” said Nyirenda.",2019-02-25 00:00:00,"k11bn, read, say, plan, invest, relate, showcase, make, come, invest, establish, commission, locate, expect, produce, say, import, advance, say, pende, delay, add, say, connect, commission, delay, go, commission, use, process, say, use, say, invest, respond, go, say, target, know, want, eat, have, have, have, have, want, take, say",20 kilometres about K738 million

    Parliament has given the nod to Ntchisi North member of Parliament (MP) Boniface Kadzamira (Independent) to draft a bill whose objective is to distinguish the criminalised Indian hemp from medicinal cannabis through cultivation, production and possession.
Kadzamira moved a motion for the House to allow him to draft the bill following vigorous consultations which have proved that cannabis can improve the country’s economy if well regulated and legalised.
Kadzamira:It will encompass two varieties
In an interview after the motion was accepted, Kadzamira said his motion was a move in the right direction, saying there is need to define the terms rightly, hinting that the bill will encompass two varieties of cannabis—industrial and medicinal.
He said: “The bill will encompass the two varieties, thus the industrial hemp and medicinal cannabis, but before it is tabled, it will go to five committees for scrutiny. At that stage we will know what Malawians will want to be included in the bill.”
Kadzamira said he will seek advice from the Legal Department of Parliament on how to go about the bill which he hopes will be presented in the House next Thursday.
Many MPs, both government and opposition, supported the motion but warned that there should be vigorous research and right definitions of cannabis to avoid confusion with the hemp that is an illegal substance.
Blantyre West MP Peter Kumpalume (Democratic Progressive Party-DPP) said the country needs to move fast to adopt some technologies and inventions, one of which being hemp but said it has to be done cautiously.
“We need to move fast. I know there is money and a lot of benefits. We need research and to change the laws so that there won’t be abuse. I, therefore, support the motion,” he said.
Responding to the motion, Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development Joseph Mwanamvekha said even though the move seems good, an extensive research needs to be done.
“This motion on chamba is quite sensitive. It requires extensive research because it is a plant which needs a lot of analysis and proper consultation so that whatever comes out will be beneficial to the country,” he said.
Parliament gave a go-ahead for industrial hemp trials at Chitedze Research Station and in Salima. The studies are still ongoing on whether it can become a viable export product after Kadzamira moved a motion for such some three years ago.
Three weeks ago, Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development, Gray Nyandule Phiri said in an interview that results for the trials of the industrial hemp are ready for analysis by Cabinet.
He said after three years of trial, the ministry is ready with the results which cannot be shared to the public yet.
Industrial hemp is the non-narcotic form of cannabis and is not psychoactive due to the low levels of tetrayhydrocannibinol (THC).
Different stakeholders in the hemp industry have been calling on government to speed up the process of legalising the growing of the hemp to make Malawi have an alternative forex earner apart from tobacco.
Currently, Zimbabwe, Morrocco and South Africa are reported to have legalised the growing of industrial hemp in Africa.
It is estimated that a kilogramme of industrial hemp fetches about K32 000 on the market and that there is potential direct annual benefit to Malawians in excess of K3 billion on 16.5 hectares or K195 million per five hectares.

If there is one city in the world that throws one into a race of wild imaginations coupled with lots of questions, it is Amsterdam.
Since time immemorial, the Dutch capital has a weird but solid reputation for being an ‘anything goes’ city.
Moneymaker: Tourists to Amsterdam cannot resist the allure of De Wallen, a popular Red Light District
Amsterdam is a relaxed, tolerant and easy-going city, but rather it is the liberal approach to sex and cannabis that makes it legendary.
The city prides itself on embracing the fact that people may be into prostitution and soft drugs. And that it is only human. So instead of criminalising everything, they enjoy the honesty of it all.
As such, tourists to the city will not boast of visiting Amsterdam without experiencing one of those two or even both—at least for the curious ones.
It was the case with some of the delegates attending the World Aids Conference, the city hosted last month.
Who would not want to experience Amsterdam after hours on end of press conferences, discussions and sessions on HIV and Aids scientific researches, among others?
So hitting De Wallen, the famous Red Light District for some was a mental massage. In Dutch, they call it De Wallen because it means the walls.
Cannabis—popularly referred to as Mary and Juana—is currently illegal. However, Dutch lawmakers in 2017 approved a legislation that permits professional cultivation.
No wonder, Amsterdam’s central business district is littered with coffee shops which are allowed to store a certain amount of locally cultivated cannabis on the shelves, at a time.

Consumers can purchase the drug as raw, or processed into well-packaged cookies, chocolates as well as ingredients for drinks.
Tourists mostly consider coffee shops as a form of entertainment. The coffee shops play a vital role in Dutch tourism.  Latest figures show that between 25 to 30 percent of people who visit Amsterdam spend time in coffee shops sampling cannabis.
Juxtaposed to the coffee shops on De Wallen are multitudes of buildings stretched along the famous red light district.
Sex is sold on De Wallen—Amsterdam’s popular Red Light District—where prostitution thrives. The trade is legal in the Netherlands but not on the streets.
That’s why prostitutes on De Wallen stand up behind a window and have their own room. The name “Red Light District” comes from the red neon lights that highlight where women are working.
Since October 2000, window prostitutes have been allowed to legally offer their services. Today, prostitutes in the Netherlands are also taxpayers.
As of 2014, the Red Light District and coffee shops or to put it frankly, sex and drugs— contributed 2.5 billion euros a year to the national economy, according to Dutch authorities.
Accompanied by a local called Perry, I was curious to visit the Red Light District.
In natural daylight, the area is less attractive as the more sordid aspects do not really reveal themselves. Simply put, it is less lively during the day but the district really comes to life when night falls.
So on this particular late Friday afternoon, Perry—a Dutchman and stranger, I met three days earlier turned friend—played the role of a tour guide around the district.
As we strolled along the street, beautiful women of different shapes and sizes from almost all angles across the globe tapped from the windows beckoning for a sumptuous action.
Almost every woman shares at least an indistinct resemblance with her scantily clad and lace-adorned slender colleague in the next window.
“How many of such windows are in Amsterdam?” I asked Perry as curiosity got the best of me.
He responded, “300.”
As we maneuvered through the historical buildings from which the window rests, the more inquisitive I became.
Sensing the barrel of questions I was about to throw at him, Perry quickly said: “You see, let’s come this evening and see what happens during the night.”
The real macho starts from around 11pm when the district is swelling with crowds, both locals and tourists. The not so- beautiful alleys undergo a total transformation as the red neon lights illuminate them together with the countless inky canals.
The women, each in their small room and behind a window, glow as the red neon lights brighten their skin into silky membranes.
As we walked into one of the pubs, my mind raced to what Perry said earlier on that there is more that happens in the Amsterdam Red Light District other than just prostitution and coffee shops.
“The district offers cultural activities such as the Museum of Prostitution and the Museum of Cannabis. You can also find peep shows, sex shops, sex theatres, and strip clubs, among others,” he told me.
Having parted ways with 25 euros and comfortably seated in the very front row for obvious reasons, it was time for a sex show in one of the theatres.
A large curtain stood still and meaningless in front until it snapped open; two naked bodies; a man and a woman started performing on stage.
I could see that they were enjoying the performance as they slowly responded to the songs playing in the background. The more I watched the couple, the more the act felt like watching choreographed dance, as the dancers changed positions to the beat and sound of the music.
Though a few metres away, it was possible to read the absence of life in their eyes. It was typical work, no play. At intervals, while in the act the man would look out into the crowd, leaving one wondering where his mind is at.
As I flashed my phone out of my bag to check the time Perry sternly warned me: “Remember it is strictly forbidden to take pictures or film women behind their windows. That rule also applies here [theatres], in strip clubs and peep shows.”
At the stage, amid some handclapping and screams, the curtain finally closes. The curtain opened again as more performers come onto the stage for what can best be termed as a variety show.
In another startling act, a performer, arguably the most flamboyant of them all, calls for three volunteers onto the stage. She had them dance and then eat a banana out of snatch!.",2018-11-08 00:00:00,"go, read, be, throw, couple, have, go, resist, go, make, pride, embrace, criminalise, enjoy, boast, visit, experience, attend, host, want, experience, hit, call, mean, refer, approve, permit, litter, allow, store, cultivate, purchase, process, package, consider, play, show, visit, spend, sample, stretch, sell, thrive, stand, have, come, highlight, work, allow, offer, put, contribute, accord, accompany, call, visit, sordid, reveal, put, come, fall, meet, turn, play, stroll, tap, beckon, share, adorn, ask, get, respond, maneuver, rest, become, sense, throw, say, see, come, see, happen, start, swell, undergo, illuminate, glow, brighten, walk, race, say, be, happen, offer, find, tell, part, seat, stand, snap, start, perform, see, enjoy, respond, play, watch, feel, watch, change, read, look, leave, wonder, flash, check, warn, remember, forbid, take, apply, scream, close, open, come, term, call, have, dance, eat",2.5 billion euros a few metres

“When we quizzed him about the owner, he admitted that the substance was his. The cannabis sativa was seized pending examination at Bvumbwe Research Station in Thyolo,” said Sulumba.
He said two weeks ago, the driver was also arrested for carrying a passenger who had chamba.

Police missions carried out in the dead of night led the law enforcers to intercept 67 bags of chamba, most of which were reportedly headed for Zimbabwe, and to arrest 56 Ethiopians who had entered Malawi with no travel documents.
The police haul happened over the past two days in three separate incidents in Kasungu, Salima and Dedza. In the incidents, the police utilised tip-off and exhibited alertness in a fresh crackdown on the criminal and illegal activities.
Chamba bags confiscated earlier this year
A Zimbabwe-registered truck, AC 8912A, was intercepted in Kasungu, loaded with 56 bags of chamba (weighing 50 kilogrammes [kg] each). Two Zimbabweans and two Malawians are remanded at Lilongwe Police Station after being involved in the purchase and attempts to conceal the chamba on the truck before its return to Zimbabwe.
The Zimbabweans are truck driver Colbert Chisandure, 35, from Harare, and businessperson Nabeti Chiwira, 37, from Mzilikazi District in Bulawayo.
The Malawians are Rodrick Naphitale, 28, of Chimbwi Village, in Traditional Authority (T/A) Khongoni in Lilongwe, and Osman Hassan, 39, of Chipalamawamba Village, T/A Mponda in Mangochi.",2067-09-10 00:00:00,"intercept, read, carry, lead, enforcer, intercept, head, arrest, enter, happen, utilise, exhibit, confiscate, register, intercept, load, weigh, remand, involve, conceal",50 kilogrammes
