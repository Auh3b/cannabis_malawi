0Police in the lake shore district of Nkhotakota have impounded 29 bags of cannabis sativa locally known as chamba that they found in an abandoned motor vehicle.
Nkhotakota police spokesperson William Kaponda confirmed this, saying: “The motor vehicle, a Toyota Carina-was abandoned on the night of March 11 2015 after the driver unexpectedly noted a snap roadblock erected by police. The driver dumped the car and disappeared, leaving the engine still running.”

Kaponda said after searching the vehicle, they found a driver’s licence as well as the bags of cannabis. The owner of the vehicle is yet to be identified.
Said Kaponda: “We encourage the public to refrain from drug-peddling to create a crime free Malawi since illicit drugs fuel criminal activities, especially among the youth.”
The spokesperson then appealed to the general public for information related to the abandoned motor vehicle and its contents since investigations are still in progress.
According to Kaponda, Nkhotakota ranks top on cannabis sativa related cases. In 2014, Nkhotakota police arrested 41 people for illegal possession of Indian hemp out of whom 28 were convicted. n

Chaponda L and the Trade and Industry Minister Joseph Mwanamveka: Hemp OK as rope, not as dope
Leader of the House George Chaponda, who is also minister of Agriculture and President Peter Mutharika’s right hand man was among the senior cabinet ministers who supported a private motion by Ntchisi north MP Boniface Kadzamira which was seeking the House to legalise the growing of the hemp.
Chaponda, who is also Mulanje South West MP said: “People from Mulanje South West would like to have it legalised but there is need to have a new vernacular name.”
He said the ministry of Agriculture through Chitedze Research Station is doing a research on the industrial hemp.
Chaponda, however wondered why it is grown in European and Asian countries including UK, China, Japan, Austria but in Africa it is grown in Egypt alone.
Minister of Trade and Industry, another powerful minister in Mutharika’s administration said the value of growing the hemp are very good.
“This crop will help Malawi move from its current position of dominantly importing nation to a dominantly exporting nation,” he said.
However, he suggested there should be legislations that would control, monitor and regulate the growth to avoid abuse.
Minister of Health Peter Kumpalume, one of the trusted ministers of Mutharika said there was need to ensure that only the right variety of the hemp is grown as indian hemp and industrial hemp come from the same family of the crop.
He agreed with others that the hemp will be useful in making cooking oil, manufacturing materials, cosmetics, clothes, among others.
Mzimba north MP told the House that Malawians should embrace this new crop saying religious and cultural beliefs should not make people fear scientific research as the country needs innovation and technology if it is to move forward.
Kadzamira told the House that the plant has enormous economical, medical and nutritional values and should be allowed to be grown.
He said all farmers wishing to grow the plant would be registered and monitored, saying this would in the long run replace tobacco which is facing a smoky future.
Kadzamira said the Linguistics Department at Chancellor College will come up with a better vernacular name other than chamba.
The motion received overwhelming support from both the government and opposition sides.

Lawyers representing John presented eight grounds for the review.
Among the grounds of the appeal, the lawyers argue that the convict was given an excessive custodial sentence for a 19-year-old in the light that there was no actual possession of the illicit drug and that the  Magistrate Court erred in law for accepting a plea contrary to the statement recorded from the convict.
In its submission, the State agreed with the defence that the sentence was excessive, however, argued that the custodial sentence was proper and must only be reduced and not quashed.
John was convicted last month and he is serving an eight-year jail sentence.

https://www.nyasatimes.com/high-court-to-review-mussas-sentence-on-indian-hemp-possession/,www.nyasatimes.com,hemp,"High Court to review Mussa’s sentence on Indian Hemp possessionJuly 12, 2022 Duncan Mlanjira - Nyasa Times Be the first to commentThe case of Mussa John, who was convicted to a mandatory custodial sentence of 8 years by the Senior Resident Magistrate Court, is set to be reviewed tomorrow, June 12 by the High Court but as a 17-year-old offender, not 19 as heard in lower court.
Now legally represented by Alexius Kamangira of Nicholls & Brookes alongside Chikondi Chijozi, Ruth Kaima, and Luntha Chimbwete of Southern Africa Litigation Centre and the Centre for Human Rights, Education Advice and Assistance, the lawyers have discovered that John was wrongly charged as a 19-year-old and they will argue that he is 17 years old — thus he should have been accorded the protection of a child under the Child Care Protection and Justice Act.
Mussa’s case to be reviewed
The notice from the High Court records that On June, 15 2022, Mussa John “was allegedly found with 78 plastic bags (weighing about 134 kilograms) of Indian Hemp at his home and charged with being found in possession of Indian Hemp without a licence — contrary to Regulation 4(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Regulations, as read with Section 19(1) of the Dangerous Drugs Act”.
“The offence of possession of Indian Hemp without a license attracts a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. When the Applicant appeared before the Magistrate’s Court, he was unrepresented, and he pleaded guilty to the offence.”
On behalf of John, the lawyers will argue in the High Court that the 8-year conviction be quashed and set aside his sentence.
The lawyers will also argue that “the Magistrate Court erred in accepting his guilty plea in circumstances where it contradicted his caution statement which indicated that he was not in possession of the Indian Hemp”.
The lawyers “will also argue that his right to a fair trial was violated as he was not provided with a legal practitioner considering the seriousness of the offence that he was charged with”.
The notice observes that the lower court record indicates that John is 19 years old, but he will argue that he is 17 years old and “even though the issue of his actual age was not presented before the lower court, he will argue that the lower court should have invoked the provisions of section 138 of the Child Care Protection and Justice Act which allows for extension of application of the Act to young persons over the age of 18”.
“He will further argue that the charge sheet was defective and that the sentence imposed by the lower court is excessive considering his age and the sentencing trends for the offence.”
The review is in the wake of a decision made by acting Chief Resident Magistrate (South), Chisomo Msokera, who found not defective teenager, Mussa John’s 8-year custodial sentence but had advised for the review of the case.
Dated June 27, 2022 under the subject ‘Confirmation and Supervisory Review of Sentencing in Rep. v John (criminal case number 475 of 2022) and Rep. v Milhade and another criminal case number 567 of 2022’), Msokera took cognizance of the hot debate that ensued soon after John’s conviction.
The hot debate was awash on social media in comparison to the sentence meted on Herve Milhade, Castel Malawi’s managing director — who was also found that he was cultivating the same illegal hemp but was just fined.
“The social media is awash with debates on the propriety of an 8 years imprisonment sentence imposed on a 19-year-old convict on a charge of possession of cannabis sativa.
“There have been questions on whether the punishment meets the demands of distributive justice since retributive sentence appears, as some claimed, off tangent some of the sentencing trends by the magistracy where fines and not custodial sentences have generally imposed.
“One of such cited cases is Rep. v Milhade and another criminal case number 567 of 2022 where the convicts were sentenced to pay a fine of K1 million and in default to serve custodial sentence of 12 months on a charge of cultivating cannabis sativa.”
Msokera observed that the case of the teenager was heard in chambers of the Senior Resident Magistrate Court because there is no designated court room space at Limbe Magistrate Court but the chambers were used as open court.
“The charge is defective as it cites a wrong punishment provision and does not cite the statute book where the offence is provided for. Section 19(1)(a) and not section 16 of the Dangerous Drugs Act is the appropriate punishment provision; and the offence is created under the Dangerous Drugs Regulations.
“The Judgement on Sentence gives reasons as to why, not withstanding the dictates of Section 340 of the Criminal Procedures and Evidence Code, the convict deserves an outright custodial sentences.”
“Msokera also observed that “the Judgement on Sentence took into consideration the mitigating circumstances of the convict being a young person” and that “other than the irregular charge, this was a proper matter which should be forwarded to a superior court strictly for proceedings of review on confirmation under section 15 of the Criminal Procedures and Evidence Code”.
“Other than what I have specifically highlighted herein, the rest of the proceedings — as far as the court record is concerned — does not strike me as defective.
“In view of the cited irregularity and considering the perceive injustice of the sentence as it relates to Milhade and another, Msokera thus invokes section 26(1) of the Courts Act in asking for a “superior court to exercise its supervisory powers in addition to the review on confirmation proceedings over both matters”.
“It is my hope that the process of supervision and review on the confirmation by the High Court shall enrich our sentencing jurisprudence to aid the courts of magistrates in meting our appropriate sentences in cases of this nature.”

The Blantyre senior resident magistrate court this week sentenced Mussa John to eight years imprisonment with hard labour for being found in possession of 78 plastics of chamba weighing 134 kilograms.
Convicted boy
Some lawyers have shown interest to seek a review of a matter probono.
Counsel Alexious Kamangira says he has already met Mussa in his preliminary investigation of the matter before taking it up to the Chief Resident Magistrate in Blantyre.
On the other hand, executive director for the Centre for Human Rights Education, Advice and Assistance (CHREAA), Victor Mhango, said they will meet the convict on Monday on the same cause.
Mhango says they will be responding to a call by some citizens to intervene on the matter, saying a fine or a suspended sentence would have been fair to the suspect being a first offender and considering his age.

“The letter allegedly signed by Honourable Lobin Clarke Lowe M.P, Minister of Agriculture, dated 1st of November 2021 and referenced as 30/1/1 is a source of great embarrassment to the Government and the people of Malawi as Mr Tyson is a registered sex offender in the United States of America, where he is expected to represent and promote Malawi cannabis. Mr Mike Tyson was convicted and jailed of raping and serious violence of an 18-year-old woman in 1992. He remains on sex offenders register in Arizona and Florida as per attached evidence,” reads the statement.
Munthali says it is surprising that Malawi would want to have a convicted rapist as its brand ambassador, more especially at the time when efforts to curb violence against women are part of the government agenda.
“As a nation that is working tirelessly to stem out gender-based violence, we cannot be seen to associate or celebrate people of Mike Tyson calibre as a face of promoting any of our products.
“We wish to believe that the letter is fake and such appointment was never considered. Or if it is true, it will be withdrawn with immediate effect.
“The CPA offers due diligence services to business and institutions in Europe, USA, China and Southern Africa to avoid such embarrassments,” warns Munthali.

MRA spokesperson, Steve Kapoloma has confirmed the incident which happened in Blantyre where the MRA officials managed to intercept 146 bags of Indian Hemp following a speed chase of a 5-tonne Isuzu lorry.
Kapoloma said the lorry, belonging to Frederick John Chiuja from Mangochi, had passed through the MRA roadblock at Lirangwe without stopping for inspection.
He said this raised suspicion and prompted a speed chase of the lorry by MRA officers who were accompanied by Police Officers.
“The lorry then turned into a dirt road towards Machinjiri and our officers and the Police continued the chase.
“The Police then fired into the air and that is when they abandoned the lorry,” he said.
Kapoloma said the team called for assistance and upon inspection of the lorry, they found 146 bags of Indian Hemp.
He said the Authority has handed over the Indian Hemp to South Lunzu Police Station who have since delivered the illicit drug to Ndirande Police Station.
“This is not the first time for MRA to intercept Indian Hemp.
“Apart from collecting revenue, it is also our mandate to protect Malawians from the importation of prohibited goods which pose a health risk,” Kapoloma said.
He said the state will prosecute the perpetrators.

Crap weed: Malawian took Cannabis to Irish police station to complain that it was “not of good quality”
Liwembe, with an address at an asylum-seekers’ reception centre,  was immediately arrested.
When the matter was taken to court, the Malawian pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of cannabis and other charges.
According to the Irish Independent, Judge John Hughes said Liwembe’s behaviour was “illogical to say the least” and was indicative of a cannabis-induced psychosis.
He adjourned the case for a probation report.
Police told the court that Liwembe went to Kilmainham Garda Station last July 10 and produced a bag of cannabis valued at €10 from his pocket.
He was searched and a box-cutter knife was found on him. The blade was for use in his work as a handyman, said defence solicitor Anne Fitzgibbon.
Liwembe, according to the reports, came  h from Malawi in 2012 as a student nurse but his visa ran out and he applied for residency on the basis of having an Irish-born child.
Liwembe had been using cannabis, which could lead to “transient psychotic symptoms”, the lawyer added.
He was now off the drug.
Judge Hughes remanded him on continuing bail.

Why me? Chamba farmer
Lyton Lunda, 91, his two sons Nervason, 74, and Alufeyo, 61, were arrested Thursday last week at Nthapangwa Lunda Village, T/A Kampingo Sibande in the district.
On Monday, police prosecutor Sergeant Snowden Chimombo told the court that the three were arrested following a tip by one of the members in the village.
“The police uprooted about 300 plants of cannabis which were found in their garden. The hemp was taken to Lunyangwa research station where it was tested and weighed 456 kilograms, including stems, seeds and roots,” Chimombo said.
The Lundas pleaded guilty to the charge of violating regulation 6(1) as read with 19(1) of the Dangerous Drugs Act and were subsequently convicted.
Chimombo said though they were all first offenders and aged, there was need for a stiffer punishment to serve as a lesson to other ganja farmers in the district.
“The convicts are old people who are responsible in society. The first accused is the village headman which means he was supposed to act responsibly and be exemplary to young ones,” he said.
In mitigation, they all pleaded with the court to exercise leniency saying they are aged and responsible for orphans.
They further promised the court never to engage in Marijuana farming again.
In his ruling, First Grade Magistrate George Longwe told the court that the offence is very serious and needed a stiffer penalty.
He, however, said the court considered charging them using section 340 of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Code.
According to the section, for first offenders, before imposing a prison sentence, a court must, by a process of elimination, rule out that a non-custodial sentence is not the proper way of dealing with the offender.
In deciding that question, the section further says the sentencing court may regard the youth, old age, character, home surroundings, health or mental condition of the accused, among other factors.
“The offense is very serious, but these are first offenders, and elderly; the oldest being 91 and the youngest being 61. In addition, they have repented that they will not do it again,” Longwe said.
He, therefore, used section 337(1) of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Code and discharged them on condition that they should not committee any offence within 12 months.

0  Driver Noel Banda may have thought he was pulling a fast escape when he crashed through a special road block set up by Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) and police officers near Madisi in Dowa at around 1am last Thursday.
But it took only a few minutes for him to realise that his game was almost over, as the officers jumped into their vehicle and gave chase to his Toyota Dyna van registration BLK 4690.
Police intercept chamba transporters in this file photograph
After a five-kilometre chase, the officers had cornered Banda to a stop. When Banda initially responded that he was carrying stationery from Mzuzu to Lilongwe, the officers expressed reservations even before they inspected the load locked away in the van.
That is how the officers found, and impounded, 68 bags of suspected Indian hemp (chamba). There was no stationery found.
MRA, which sets up such patrols based on intelligence information that illicit goods are transported in the wee hours of the night in certain ‘porous’ areas, handed over the suspected chamba to  Lilongwe Police Station on Monday morning.
Lilongwe Police Station spokesperson Kingsley Dandaula said samples of the haul will be sent to Chitedze Research Station for analysis before a charge can be pressed against Banda, who is being kept at the station’s cells.
Dandaula praised MRA for their innovative special patrols nationwide which he said are helping the Malawi Police Service (MPS) in clamping down on criminal activities.
MRA head of corporate affairs Steve Kapoloma yesterday saluted the police for helping his organisation to put a stop to the movement of illicit goods.
“Our special patrols, which also target border areas where Indian hemp and other drugs may be easily moved in or outside Malawi through uncharted routes, have proved very successful. This latest catch is proof that we need to work harder in securing our roads and our nation,” he said. n",07/12/2017,"driver, read, think, pull, crash, set, take, realise, jump, give, intercept, corner, respond, carry, express, inspect, lock, find, impound, suspect, be, find, set, base, transport, hand, suspect, say, send, press, keep, praise, say, help, clamp, salute, help, put, target, move, prove, need, work, secure, say",five-kilometre,68,bags,,,,,Dowa,Farming,1

0  Nkhotakota Forestry Department on Saturday made a surprise raid in Dwambazi Forest Reserve where they destroyed Indian hemp and other crops planted by encroachers.
Similar attempts to drive out the encroaching communities, particularly from traditional authorities Kanyenda and Kafuzira, have proven futile as encroachers continue breaking new ground.
A forestry officer slashes chamba and beans
The operation, jointly conducted with armed game rangers from African Parks which is managing Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve under a 20 year-long concession in a public private partnership arrangement, saw hundreds of hectares of Indian hemp, commonly called chamba, being destroyed while other crops such as beans, soya beans and maize were also slashed down.
In an interview after the exercise, district forestry officer George Ziphophe said he is not happy with the rate at which the forest is fast being turned into a hotspot for chamba cultivation.
He said the forest is being targeted for cultivation because of its fertile soils.
“There are a number of factors that compel these people to encroach into the forest. One such factor is fertility. The soils are very rich in mineral salts, hence, they do cultivate without fertiliser.
“Additionally, the moisture content is good such that they do farm in summer. But we cannot condone such illegal practice to prevail. We will take them head on,” he said.
According to a 2009 Nkhotakota District Social Profile, the 36 600 hectare forest reserve, which was gazetted in 1996, had 145 encroaching households that occupied about 283 hectares.
Dwambazi Forest Reserve is one of the largest water catchment areas where rivers such as Dwambazi, Mkoma, Khuyu, Luluzi, and Chiphumbulu. n",31/10/2017,"destroy, plant, read, make, destroy, plant, drive, encroach, prove, continue, break, slash, conduct, manage, see, call, destroy, soya, slash, say, turn, say, target, be, compel, encroach, cultivate, do, condone, prevail, take, say, accord, gazette, have, encroach, occupy",about 283 hectares,,,,,,,Nkhotakota,Farming,

0Following successful industrial hemp trials at Chitedze Research Station in Lilongwe, government has approved to have the trials conducted in other environments.
The station has so far tested 10 varieties acquired from Europe, China and Australia to assess if they have low levels of the substance that drive people crazy when they smoke marijuana. The trials, which started in 2015, are expected to end this year.
Speaking during presentation of the findings at this year’s annual review and planning meeting in Mzuzu on Tuesday, Department of Agriculture Research Services (Dars) chief scientist Laurent Pungulani said the trials have established that the varieties have lower levels of the substance compared to the limit set by the international community.
He said following the Chiteze Research Station trials, Dars has given the go-ahead to have the varieties tested in other places.
“I have in mind Chitala Research Station which has a completely different environment from Chitedze because it is very hot. Probably, we will have to have another trial where temperatures are low and a good example could be Bvumbwe Research Station because it is cooler and receives high rainfall,” said Pungulani.
InveGrow director Tanya Clarke, whose company is a stakeholder in the trials, said some foreign investors are already inquiring about the industrial hemp although some are confusing it with marijuana.
“We are getting a lot of interest coming our way from international investors, but there is still confusion on marijuana and industrial hemp.

Concurring with Juziwell, Kasungu First Grade Magistrate, Damiano Banda said; “If dangerous drugs like Indian hemp are not guarded, it would be a threat to the society especially young people.”

Senior Superintendent Charles Mpezeni of Rumphi Police Station said police were tipped-off that the suspect was cultivating Indian hemp in his garden, which prompted police investigation.
“We received a tip from well-wishers that someone was cultivating Indian hemp and we organised an operation which led to the arrest of the suspect and the uprooting of 405 plants of cannabis in his garden. The suspect planted Indian hemp on an anthill which was in the middle of his maize field. This is where the plants of cannabis were uprooted,” said Mpezeni.

Mulanje Police Station spokesperson Gresham Ngwira said John Namowa, 36, from Namani Village, Traditional Authority (T/A) Njema in Mulanje, was arrested during a sweeping exercise.
He said police officers from Muloza Police Post received a tip claiming that Namowa was keeping chamba at his house.
“When the officers went there, they found 17 plastic bags of cannabis sativa, each weighing about five kilogrammes. Namowa was arrested immediately and the product has since been taken to Bvumbwe Research Station for examination,” said Ngwira.

In April this year, police in Mulanje also arrested two brothers, Wyson Simeon, 58, and Sankhani Simeon, 53, accusing them of cultivating Chamba in a fence behind their houses.

Chamba convict
The convict with his two bags of Chamba
The soldier Noel Kabango (35), working at the Support Battalion and the gang members were  arrested following a robbery at Chipiku shop in Nkhoma where over K3 million  was stolen last month when they were armed with a rifle from the MDF containing 19 rounds of ammunition.
The soldier and his three accomplices  Jafali Bashiri (20), Mixon Banda (36) and Lyton Magombo (25),  pleaded guilty to taking part in a robbery on August 26 this year and hacked shop manager.
Malawi soldiers have previously appealed for an increase in their salaries, said to be meagre.
But Principal resident magistrate Patrick Chirwa said a soldier and prison officer should have been the last people to engage in crimes considering that they were entrusted with the security of the country.
“Yet, here we have them at the forefront using the skills and training they were entrusted with to terrorise their own beneficiaries. It is a very upsetting situation. For these reasons, I do not think a non-custodial sentence could serve the purpose in sentencing them.
“It is better for them to nurse their remorse while serving a long custodial sentence than for them to be let loose within the shortest period of time when the potential of them regrouping for further crimes is still in sight.”
Chirwa said the offenders deserved more than the recommended 10 years imprisonment because they did not just brandish a dangerous weapon, but they used it to inflict three painful scars on a helpless victim.
Elsewhere
In Dowa, first grade magistrate court has convicted and sentenced Weluzani Singade (35- years) and Kwame Banda (21-years) to 30 and 20 months imprisonment with had labour (IHL) respectively without the option of fine,  for being found in possetion of Indian hemp.
The two convicts comited the offences on different days.
But they were all busted on a road block.
The first case was prosecuted by constable Regina  Kumwenda and the second case was prosecuted by sergeant Triza Kalonjele.
The two prosecutors told the court to give stiffer sentences to deter other would be offenders.
The fisrt grade magistrate Amulan Phiri agreed with the prosecutors for a stiff sentences.
He therefore sentenced them to 30 and 20 months repectively without the option of fine.

The bags were in a vehicle registration number ZA 1580 which was impounded by the Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) at Lirangwe customs roadblock in Blantyre in January this year.
The vehicle was on its way to Blantyre from Nkhotakota.

In an interview when the police burnt the consignment at Machinjiri Township on Saturday, Chileka Police spokesperson, Grace Mwale, said people who were caught with the consignment are still at large after they bolted when MRA officials intercepted them.
“So far our investigations have not revealed the real owner [of the hemp] but the van which was used to transport the consignment has been handed over to the owner as there is no link between the owner and the consignment,” said Mwale.
She also said the consignment has been burnt following tests conducted at Bvumbwe Research Station proved it was indeed chamba.

“As police, there is really nothing else we can do at this stage apart from burning it because both the driver and his assistant are still at large since escaping from the hands of authorities at Lirangwe road block early this year,” he said.
Malawi Revenue Authority had earlier on handed over the consignment to Police for investigations and disposal.

Belewa: Why me?
Police Prosecutor Sergeant Christopher Nyirongo told the court that the suspects Boniface Brasho 23, Gift Banda 37, George Biliwita 22, Memory Banda 23 and Mayeso Misomali 30 were found with over 700 kilograms of the illegal herb on 6th April, 2016 within Balaka town.
“The suspects were traveling in motor vehicles Toyota Noah registration number NU 5035 and a Toyota Corolla registration number KA 4516 from Nkhotakota heading Zomba, and were intercepted within Balaka Town after the Police erected an abrupt road block,” he said.
The suspects pleaded guilty to the offence of being found in possession of Indian hemp and upon submission of the facts by the state.
Nyirongo asked the court to consider giving the suspects a stiffer sentence considering that “the suspect are not first offenders” as they were also convicted by the Salima Magistrate Court on the similar charge.
He said this shows that they are not changing hence the need for a stiffer sentence.
In their mitigation, the suspects pleaded for forgiveness saying they were doing this because of poverty and that they have children to look after.
Passing judgment, First Grade Magistrate Felix Mandala said the suspects deserved stiffer sentences and then ordered Boniface Brasho and George Biriweti to pay a fine of K60, 000.00 each and in default serve a 6 months custodial sentence.
The Magistrate also ordered Gift Banda, Memory Banda and Mayeso Misomali to pay a fine of K30, 000.00 each and in default serve a 3 months custodial sentence.
Mandala said he has given them such a sentence so that it should be lesson to them and would be offenders. The court has also ordered that the cannabis sativa be destroyed.
All the suspects paid the fines.
In a related development Police in Dowa this week arrested a 44-year-old man on suspicion that he was cultivating Indian hemp.
Dowa Police spokesperson Richard Kaponda identified  the suspecr as Luka Belewa.
He said police also uprooted the plant grown on about half an acre.
Kaponda said the suspect comes from Mtengowopota Village, Traditional Authority (T/A) Msakambewa in the district.

Chamba peddlers in with their bags containing the ‘golden leaf’
Chief Resident Magistrate, Thomson Ligowe jailed Jambo Jambo, 42, and his accomplice Boniface Chinthenga 40 years old after they pleaded not guilty to the charge of being found in possession of Cannabis Sativa contrary to Section 4 (a) of the Dangerous Drugs Regulations and 19 (1) of Dangerous Drugs Act.
Police prosecutor, Superintendent Moja Phiri told the court that the two were arrested by the police who mounted an adhoc roadblock at Green Corner along Chikwawa road in Blantyre.
Jambo was arrested on 23rd December, 2015 while his accomplice- who had escaped- was arrested a day later.
Phiri disclosed that 40 bags of Chamba were recovered from a lorry and a minibus the two were using to ferry the illegal substance.
The Indian hemp, the court was told, was firstly packed in the minibus driven by Chinthenga before being transferred to into the lorry driven by Jambo which had carried maize husks to be delivered in Nsanje district.
Chinthenga had managed to escape but was later on traced and arrested.
Magistrate Ligowe convicted the two after four witnesses testified against them including Doctor Moses Munthali, an analyst from Bvumbwe Research Station.
Jambo hails from Jambo village, T/A Mbenje in Nsanje while Chinthenga
comes from Ndalama village, T/A Chikowi in Zomba district.
Cultivating or selling of Indian hemp is illegal in Malawi though currently government is doing trials on industrial hemp as one of the strategies to boost the country’s ailing economy.

0A Nkhotakota Police Station 2015 report indicates that 71 people were convicted for illegal possession of Indian hemp (chamba) compared to 20 people in 2014, representing a139 percent increase.
Statistics in the report show that from January 1 to December 30 2015, 81 cases of illegal possession of hemp were recorded, of which 71 were convicted, four are remanded, two were acquitted while four are on police bail.

Nkhotakota Police Station spokesperson Williams Kaponda said in 2015, the station intensified its operations resulting in being recognised as the second best performers in the Central Region.
He said: “We worked hard because we wanted to eradicate crime. The station management fully supported all initiatives that assisted in the fight against drug abuse. It is not a mean achievement to register 71 convictions from 20 the previous year.”
Kaponda also attributed the success to the cordial relationship between the police and communities who played an important role in whistle-blowing.

0It took officers from the Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) to impound a truckload of 109 bags of Indian hemp (chamba) at Lirangwe roadblock in Blantyre north in January 2016.
The drugs—which presumably originated from Nkhotakota—were destined for Blantyre city and only the timely interception of the tax officers put a stop to a huge consignment that had eluded officers at a number of police checkpoints in between the two areas—which are almost 400km apart.
Police officers inspect the chamba that was intercepted at Lirangwe
Southern Region police spokesperson James Kadadzera expressed surprise at the efficiency with which the syndicate transporting the drug had managed to elude several police checkpoints until it was stopped by an unlikely agency.
Questions have been asked regarding the effectiveness of police roadblocks in the wake of high profile breaches where huge volumes of the illicit drug—which is mainly produced in Nkhotakota and Mzimba—has found  its way into the country’s major cities, causing both security and health concerns.
But amid questions over the law enforcers’ ability to nip drug trafficking in the bud, Malawi Police Service national spokesperson Nicholas Gondwa has backed police officers for their diligence and alertness, but he blamed the country’s road network as the chief cause for such lapses.
“We are doing everything in our powers to stop drug cartels from trafficking chamba into towns and cities. Unfortunately, our efforts are being hampered by the country’s road network. There are a lot of unchartered routes from Nkhotakota to Zalewa routes which these people use. Normally they get caught closer to Blantyre where their options are few and far between,” he said in a telephone interview on Monday.
Gondwa said police had information that drug peddlers branch off into earth roads before Sharpe Valley in Ntcheu and use roads that skirt the mountains all the way to Mtonda—beating three roadblocks at Sharpe Valley, Salima turn off and Chingeni.
He, however, insisted that the police are containing the situation through mounting ad hoc roadblocks on the country’s roads.
“People should know that those roadblocks are mounted based on intelligence. Currently, all police station management officers have been encouraged to use this method and it has been very effective in dealing with crime,” Gondwa said.
While acknowledging the strides the police are making in arresting chamba traffickers, executive director for Drug Fight Malawi, Nelson Zakeyu, blamed the opening of new markets for chamba.
“We appreciate that the police are doing their part under difficult circumstances. They do not have enough resources in terms of equipment and personnel.
“But we have seen an escalation of drug trafficking especially chamba of late. We believe the influx of foreign artists who drum up support for its legalisation is creating a bigger demand for hemp in the country.
“This is dangerous especially to people under the age of 21 who might have their brains permanently damaged when they take the drug,” he said.
Some stakeholders, such as ministries of Home Affairs, Health and Education and civil society organisations, have raised concerns over the escalation in the uptake of illicit drugs by young people in the country. The police have been held responsible for the failure to get things under control.
Martha Savala, a parent from Traditional Authority Khombedza’s area in Salima, said it is high time the government put up serious measures to deal with the chamba network.
“It is always mind-boggling that the police always want to arrest the situation at the end of the distribution chain. No wonder they are failing to control the trafficking of chamba. In fact they should have addressed the problem from the source by blocking production. They [police] know exactly where chamba is produced, how come they do not arrest the growers?” she queried.
While Gondwa blamed the country’s road network for the proliferation of chamba traffickers escaping the police dragnet CaananNyirenda, a transporter based in Mzuzu, said the law enforcers should find another excuse.
“It is not easy for chamba traffickers to use side routes to escape from drug enforcement agencies as it is being claimed. One only has to look at the country’s state of roads to realise that it is quite a tall order for those that transport chamba to divert to unchartered routes. The police needs to tighten the screws within its establishment to ensure corruption among officers manning roadblocks is eliminated,” said Nyirenda.
According to Maziko Matemba, executive director at Health Rights and Education Programme, the question of infiltration in the police rank and file should be a priority area the law enforcers have to work on.
“The health challenges that chamba causes are so enormous and they eat up a portion of the country’s health budget. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the government to stop being defensive and start addressing the problem by increasing drug enforcement efforts. They do not have to leave this job to police alone, different agencies such as the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) should also be roped in,” he said.
But commenting on why there is a veil of secrecy when disposing off of large consignments of chamba which has already been used as evidence by the courts, Gondwa said the laws of the country are used to determine how this should be done.
“Whenever the courts have used the drug as evidence they release it to be destroyed and the police, Judiciary and the Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services all witness this exercise. That is what the law demands. Nowadays, whenever possible, we invite the media to be part of the team but that is not mandatory. All the hemp is destroyed when released by the courts,” he said.

This came after the police at KIA on Thursday also intercepted another package of chamba (Cannabis sativa) weighing 4kg posted from Harare, again, en route to an address in London, UK.
Both the Thursday and Saturday packages were posted through Kenyan Airways flying to the United Kingdom through KIA, according Sgt. Sapulain Chitonde, spokesperson for KIA Police.
The chamba was packaged in form of cakes and wrapped in carbon papers spread with hot pepper outside apparently to kill the drug’s notable smell, according to Chitonde.
But unlike the Thursday package which bore the name, Clayton Hickey, as the one who posted it in Harare and Richard Peterson as the recipient in London, the Saturday package had Mary Jackson, and Paul Jackson, as the sender in Harare and receiver in London respectively.
“We have not yet made any arrest in connection with the chamba packages but we are currently communicating with our counterparts in Zimbabwe to work together in tracing the culprits,” said Chitonde.
Between September and November 2015 KIA handled over 10 similar cases except that the parcels were posted from Blantyre to various destinations in Europe mostly via Ethiopian Airways.
During the same period, Police in Blantyre arrested Nigerian national, Mzee Chidiebere at Blantyre Post Office on suspicions that he was behind the posting of the packages of chamba to Europe.
Importation, exportation, possession or consumption of chamba is illegal in Malawi under Sec. 11 (A) of the Penal Code as read with Regulation 19 of Dangerous Drug Act, according to Chitonde.

Malawi Police at Kamuzu International Airport (KIA) in Lilongwe Thursday intercepted Cannabis sativa, locally known as chamba, in cake form, weighing 4 kilogrammes.
According to KIA Police Public Relations Officer (PRO) Sapulain Chitonde, the illegal drug was wrapped in carbon papers covered with pepper “to disguise the smell and beat security.”
“The parcel was posted from Zimbabwe by a Cleyton Hickey, 19, whose address is Oakland Road, Braeside, Harare and it was going to Richard Peterson, 89, of Woodheyes Road, London, using Zimbabwean Post Office on Kenyan Airways from Zimbabwe through Malawi to the UK,” said Chitonde.

He added that KIA Police have stepped up security at the airport especially when it comes to scrutinising every parcel that enters or leaves the airport, hence the interception of the illicit drug.
The KIA Police PRO said no arrest has been made so far because the parcel was sent from Zimbabwe.
“We will communicate with our colleagues in Zimbabwe so that they can trace the sender using the name and address that we have,” said Chitonde.

Illegal importation of dangerous drugs is contrary to section 11 as read with regulation 19 of the Dangerous Drugs Act.
KIA Police have in the past intercepted a number of illegal exports and imports which include the lucrative but banned game trophies popularly known as ivory and round wood.

Malawi Revenue Authority confiscates 109 bags of chamba

The Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) on Sunday evening impounded a vehicle carrying 109 bags of cannabis sativa, popularly known as Chamba, each weighing about 30 kilogrammes at its Lirangwe customs roadblock in Blantyre.
MRA officials estimate the consignment to be worth billions.
Chamba is still illegal in the country and officials at the tax-collecting body have said the van registration ZA 1580 and owned by Chatherm Technologies was on its way to Blantyre from Nkhotakota.

Apparently, the van managed to cross all the roadblocks along the country’s main roads with the consignment.
But officials manning the Lirangwe road block, which checks any goods going in and out of Blantyre City, say they stopped and forced the driver and three other people out of the vehicle upon his reluctance to voluntarily allow the officers to search the vehicle.
They searched the van and noticed that all the 109 bags it was transporting were actually filled with the illegal herb.

The officials at the road block also stated that Police are yet to make any arrest on matter as the driver and the other three escaped as the police were searching the van.
So far Michael Mlenga of Nancholi Township in Blantyre has claimed ownership of the vehicle which is white in colour although its registration documents indicate it is red and is owned by a Mr. B Chawawa.
In an interview later, Deputy Director of Corporate Affairs at MRA, Steven Kapoloma, confirmed the development, saying police are really yet to make any arrests.
“Indeed as MRA we impounded a van which was transporting about 109 bags of chamba to Blantyre, this is part of our mandate as apart from collecting tax we also are under obligation to protect Malawian citizens from hazardous goods and products which may enter the country through our borders,” Kapoloma said.
Meanwhile, Kapoloma has also said MRA has officially handed over the Indian hemp to the police to help with investigations and disposal.
“Our role as MRA ended when we handed over the consignment to the Police to investigate and dispose of the consignment, but still more we will follow through the whole process,” He said.

0  Cultivation and subsequent use of industrial hemp could be the solution to solving Malawi’s unrelenting economic challenges, executive director of Malawi Watch, Billy Banda, has said.
Speaking on Monday in an interview in Lilongwe, Banda urged donors who are not directly financing government, to channel resources to research of industrial hemp.
Said Banda: “Industrial hemp is not for smoking and I am confident both the former and current proponents are not smokers, but simply think of the benefits.”
Chiyembekeza: Trials will take years
Banda said by legalising the plant, potential benefits could be borne through the manufacturing of drugs, clothes, paper, cars, just to mention a few.
“Another positive aspect is the Malawi Pharmacy, Medicines and Poisons Board [PMPB] will be mandated to issue licenses and also certify which variety is grown and in what quantity,” he said.
Banda said government is struggling to convince the buyer to buy tobacco at fair price.
Banda: Economically viable
In recent years, tobacco continued to face international pressure from the anti-smoking lobbyists championed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) through its Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) guidelines which seek to abolish tobacco farming in near future.
During the Vision 2020 consultations, the legalisation of industrial hemp was raised by former member of Parliament (MP) and then deputy minister of Agriculture Joe Manduwa.
Following Manduwa’s footsteps, incumbent member of Parliament for Ntchisi North Boniface Kadzamira has also caused uproar in Parliament earlier this year when he revived the campaign.
Meanwhile, industrial hemp trials are underway in Lilongwe.
The industrial hemp has been grown on a one hectare plot using certified seed imported from Canada, Australia and Europe. A commercial licence will be granted upon successful completion of the trials in 2016.
In an interview earlier with Business News Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development, Allan Chiyembekeza, said the research will take two to three years and if it works out it will only be cultivated in commercial farms.
“This is not chamba [marijuana]. It is a new introduction and the leaves do not contain much substance that is hallucinating as chamba itself,” Chiyembekeza said.
He said the role of government has been to introduce the species and researchers will do chemical analysis to see how it compares with chamba to ascertain if the chemical content is indeed different. n

Andrew Mitochi (34) of Kamuzu Barracks in mitigation said he was remorseful.

“We expect you as the law enforcers to be the exemplary in respecting the laws that you enforce. Hence a stiff punishment is required for you for others to learn a lesson,” Said Buleya.
He went on to sentence Andrew Mitochito pay a fine of K100, 000 or in default serve two year Imprisonment with Hard Labour (IHL).
Mitochi was arrested on Monday 19, this year at Kaombe roadblock when he was travelling from Dwangwa heading to Lilongwe on Dihatsu Mira Salon registration number IT 6496.
When police manning the checkpoint searched his motor vehicle discovered Indian hemp packed in two military bags.
The other convicts Gilbert Sichali (32) and John Gunde (34) were arrested after being found with 365 and 170 kilograms of cannabis sativa respectively.
Sichali and Gunde were arrested on October 16 and 22 and concealed the illicit drug on cartons and woven baskets.
They all admitted to the charge and were convicted and ordered ti pay a fine of K 350, 000 and K 80,000 or in default serve three years and one year and eight months IHL respectively.
Mitochi has since paid the fine while Gilbert Sichali and John Gunde are yet to pay the fine. They are currently at Nkhotakota prison.
The trio convicts Andrew Mitochi (34) and Gilbert Sichali (32) hail from Tito and Kamtekete villages respectively, in the area of senior chief Kanyenda in Nkhotakota district while John Gunde (35)of Chibweya village in the area of traditional authority MpandoNtcheu district.

Chamba peddlers in Nkhotakota with their bags containing the ‘golden leaf’
While the Nkhotakota operation was done by the Police and Game Rangers, the Kasungu operation was by the Police and the Courts simply because the latest case was under the courts confinement. In Nkhotakota the drug was found in a farm in a game reserve and was destroyed in the gardens.
Part of the Kasungu consignment was confiscated from Mbiriyakula Maliko and two others at Kalenga Trading Centre in the Area of Traditional Authority Wimbe in the district.
The other was found by the Police at Chisazima and Bua roadblocks.
The owners were however not traced but Malio and his colleagues convicted and fined K50, 000 each by the Kasungu Magistrate Court.
Kasungu Police Public Relations Officer Edwin Kaunda confirmed of the development which comes at a time when Malawi President Peter Mutharika approved the cultivation of industrial hemp.
Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development Allan Chiyembekeza said  the approval is for trial purposes in the country and that the industrial hemp is not the same as much talked about and known Indian hemp.
“Let me point out that industrial hemp is different from the much talked Indian hemp chamba or Cannabis Sativa] that is prohibited. This [industrial] hemp does not contain the psychoactive chemical elements that affect people when smoked even though it is from the same family of crops,” Chiyembekeza said.
Indian hemp legalization debate took a center stage across the country and three months ago the issue was even raised in Parliament for debate, and the minister explained last month that should the trials be successful, the industrial hemp will be another source of foreign exchange earnings.

Renewed calls for hemp cultivation

By Rebecca Chimjeka:
Foreign nationals have started visiting the country on fact-finding missions related to the cultivation of Indian hemp for industrial purposes.
In 2015, President Peter Mutharika gave Invegrow Hemp Power Malawi the nod to embark on industrial hemp cultivation on trial basis.

And, on the international scene, the government of Canada recently legalised the cultivation of Indian hemp for medical use.
Speaking after meeting a group of foreign nationals that is interested in investing in the country, Ntchisi North Member of Parliament (MP), Boniface Kadzamira, asked the government to consider legalising cultivation of all types of hemp in the country.
Kadzamira said investors are ready to invest in 50,000 thousand hectares of both industrial and some hemp verities that are cultivated for medical purposes.

“The country has all it can to grow hemp for both medical and industrial purposes. The government should emulate what some African countries are doing by putting some guidelines on the cultivation of such types of hemp,” Kadzamira said.
The call comes four years after the MP moved a motion in Parliament that would pave the way for cultivation of industrial hemp for trial purposes.
Graham Mackintosh, spokesperson for Green Quest Farmarceuticals, whose company is searching for 50,000 hectares in Africa, said Indian hemp is on high demand in Europe.
“It’s high time the Malawi government considered legalising the type of hemp that World Health Organisation has approved to shore up foreign exchange earnings as well as support the national export strategy and priority sectors of the government,” Mackintosh said.
But Secretary for Agriculture, Grey Nyandule Phiri, said cultivation of the crop is prohibited.

0Growing, using, or possessing marijuana is illegal in Malawi. But it appears both production and sales are rising.
The growth in sales means that growers cultivating the drug are motivated by large profits they gain from its sales.
A pregnant woman blows a blunt at Matafale Memorial
The production and selling of chamba has been increasing in the country over the years.
However, it is arguably premature to ascertain if efforts to curb its production are also on the increase.
In 2010 alone, the Malawi Police Service confiscated about 70 000 kilogrammes of the illicit drug.
According to the United Nations figures on number of chamba seizures in Malawi from 1995 to 2000 published in the 2003 Institute for Security Studies Report, 403 500 kilogrammes of cannabis was impounded.
The availability of ‘weed’ has reached an alarming rate in the country.
And this is evident in public spheres.
At almost every secular music show, revellers party with either chamba or smoke emanating from it.
Merchants openly selling chamba at the Matafale Memorial in Chileka, Blantyre last year
Men and women are publicly seen selling the product, even luring customers by capitalising on the perceived benefits of chamba.
All this happens in full view of police officers, who are there to ensure security at the shows. Yet, this hallucinogenic variant is banned in Malawi.
In 2000, the Rastafari
community in Malawi went to court to demand the right to smoke marijuana.
This subsequently resulted in government briefly exploring the possible legalisation of Indian hemp, despite police warnings of potential abuse by cannabis growers.
This was championed in Parliament by the then Deputy Minister of Agriculture Joe Manduwa, who argued that the plant could be a valuable alternative to tobacco.
The idea was supported by a number of MPs, but it never saw the light of day, meaning chamba remains illegal in Malawi.
Malawi Police Service press and public relations officer, Rhoda Manjolo, says the responsibility of providing security is for everyone in the country.
“People need to be proactive in terms of security and not wait for the police to always act. It is high time we start taking a collective measure. There are a lot of people who have been arrested for being found in possession of chamba, for instance.
“Talking about chamba smoking or selling at musical shows, there are a lot of people at such events as compared to the number of police officers, who are evidently busy with other equally important things,” she says.
Manjolo explains that sometimes the police miss out on certain things happening at the event.
“Again, police feel that arresting people at such places is disturbing the freedom and enjoyable environment for people,” she explains.
On their part, Musicians Union of Malawi (MUM) says police are to blame for the proliferation of chamba, even in townships where youths are openly puffing on the blunt.
“Some police personel do not go to musical shows to work, but to enjoy with the people; hence, they forget their number one responsibility: security. The police are to blame because they are mandated by law to control any kind of misbehaviour.
“As MUM, we have agreed that no one should be seen smoking chamba in public and check around, many musicians are respecting that. It’s the fans and the police that are misbehaving,” argues the union’s president Reverend Chimwemwe Mhango.
Clinical psychologist Chiwoza Bandawe contends the police are not assuming their key responsibility of enforcing law and order.
“People are motivated by profit and are attracted to where there are customers. A social event is attractive to such persons. Therefore; people take advantage of social events like musical gigs to do things like the sell or smoking of chamba.
“However, this demonstrates that the enforcement agencies are not actively enforcing the law. The society is also watching without approaching such people and asking to smoke elsewhere or to stop,” he states.
According to Bandawe, marijuana is a harmful substance whose main chemical ingredient is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is a fatty substance that remains in the body for up to three months after smoking.
It is associated with mental health problems in particular cannabis induced psychosis due to damage to the brain cells that THC causes.

‘Indian hemp cultivation not rampant in Nkhotakota’

June 24, 2015

Malawi police in Dwangwa have said cultivation of Indian hemp in Nkhotakota is not as serious as people allege but the district is only used as a route for traffickers.
When asked to comment on the severity of Indian hemp cultivation in the Central Region district, Nkhunga Police Station spokesperson Austin Kaunda said Mzimba is the main producer and supplier of Indian hemp not Nkhotakota.
“We have records that many traffickers are not from Nkhotakota but from other districts like Blantyre, Lilongwe, Mangochi, Balaka and Salima who pass through from Mzimba where they buy the hemp.

“So, what I can say is that the problem is serious in terms of trafficking because Nkhotakota is used as a route,” he said.
Kaunda also said this year alone police have confiscated 5,238 kilogrammes of Indian hemp following the arrests of 13 traffickers.
The figure is much higher compared to 509 kilogrammes of marijuana police confiscated the whole of last year after arresting 24 people.

The police publicist commended the good working relationship between police and the public.
“We arrest traffickers because of tips from members of the general public and we ask them to continue giving us information,” Kaunda said.
He further said police are aware that small numbers of people are still cultivating the illicit drug in Nkhotakota’s northern part along Lupachi River which borders Mzimba.
“We have had operations to uproot hemp in the past. In 2011 we carried out a joint operation with fellow officers from headquarters where we uprooted about four acres of Indian hemp along Lupachi River. Plans are there to carry out another operation but we are failing due to financial constraints,” said Kaunda.
Soaring number of cases of people caught trafficking Indian hemp from Nkhotakota prompted people to conclude that the district is the country’s largest grower of Indian hemp.

Police missions carried out in the dead of night led the law enforcers to intercept 67 bags of chamba, most of which were reportedly headed for Zimbabwe, and to arrest 56 Ethiopians who had entered Malawi with no travel documents.
The police haul happened over the past two days in three separate incidents in Kasungu, Salima and Dedza. In the incidents, the police utilised tip-off and exhibited alertness in a fresh crackdown on the criminal and illegal activities.
Chamba bags confiscated earlier this year
A Zimbabwe-registered truck, AC 8912A, was intercepted in Kasungu, loaded with 56 bags of chamba (weighing 50 kilogrammes [kg] each). Two Zimbabweans and two Malawians are remanded at Lilongwe Police Station after being involved in the purchase and attempts to conceal the chamba on the truck before its return to Zimbabwe.
The Zimbabweans are truck driver Colbert Chisandure, 35, from Harare, and businessperson Nabeti Chiwira, 37, from Mzilikazi District in Bulawayo.
The Malawians are Rodrick Naphitale, 28, of Chimbwi Village, in Traditional Authority (T/A) Khongoni in Lilongwe, and Osman Hassan, 39, of Chipalamawamba Village, T/A Mponda in Mangochi.",30/05/2015,"intercept, read, carry, lead, enforcer, intercept, head, arrest, enter, happen, utilise, exhibit, confiscate, register, intercept, load, weigh, remand, involve, conceal",50 kilogrammes,,,,,,,,,

Rastafarian man smoking cannabis
Cannabis is regarded as a “sacred commodity” by Rastas and they have been campaigning to have laws allow them to use and sell cannabis as part of their religious beliefs and culture.
Dung their routine search on the night of February 4, 2015, police found Pitilizani Lapukeni with the ‘luggage’ aboard a National Bus Company bus registration BQ 4132 going to Blantyre from Mzuzu.
“Soon after the bus arrived at Kaombe Police roadblock, all passengers disembarked for police search. In the process, they discovered five baskets put together and concealed in black plastic paper which contained the illicit drug,” said Nkhotakota Police spokesperson Williams Kaponda.
The weed is widely grown in Nkhotakota.
He added: “A few minutes later the man came to a police officer conducting the search and offered him K4 000 to let him pass with the dangerous drugs. This prompted the officers manning the roadblock to identify the owner of the baskets and was immediately arrested.”
The suspect has been charged with an offence of being found in possession of Cannabis Sativa without license contrary to section 4 (a) of Dangerous Drug Regulation and 19 (1) of the Dangerous Drug Act.
Lapukeni hails from Mbaluku village, Senior Chief Malengachanzi in the district and is expected to appear before Nkhotakota Magistrate Court soon.
Following such growing cases which have become rampant in the district, police have appealed to the general public to come forward with information that will lead to curbing the malpractice.
Police, further remind the general public that rewards are still being made to patriotic Malawians who come forward with information which lead to the arrest of the drug traffickers.
But the Rasta continue to argue that the constitution allows everyone’s entitlement to freedom of  religion, including Rastafarian which allows use of Chamba regarded as a “sacred commodity” and “sacrament incense” with authority for its use derived from the Bible.
They regard Chamba as a herb originally grown in the Garden of Eden for the use of mankind for religious, culinary and medicinal purposes.
And that they don’t sell Chamba in open market as they  do it in their “Rastafarian gatherings” comparing the practise of Christian churches holding summer fairs and coffee mornings for fund raising purposes.

Hemp the woman hid in the baskets
Police Prosecutor Sergeant Getrude Chingolo Kafumbula told the court that the suspect Veronica Mwala was on 1st December last year at Chingeni road block found with two baskets containing Indian hemp weighing 62.5 kilograms which is contrary to regulation 19(1) as read with 4(a) of Dangerous Drug Act.
“The suspect was traveling in a motor vehicle registration number BP 1870 from Nkhotakota heading Blantyre, and upon being searched at Chingeni road block, it was discovered that the baskets that had dried fish on top contained Indian hemp,” Kafumbula told the court.
The suspect pleaded guilty to the offence and upon submission of the facts by the state, the court found her with the case to answer and consequently convicted her.
In her submission before sentence Kafumbula asked the court to consider giving the suspect a stiffer sentence saying that people like Veronica are the ones who are contributing to the bad behavior of the youths.
“Giving such people a stiffer sentence can be one way of protecting our children” Kafumbula said.
In her mitigation, the suspect Veronica Mwala asked for forgiveness saying she was doing this because of poverty and that she has five children to look after. She said the father of the children divorced her and she is the only parent who looks after them.
Passing judgment, Second Grade Magistrate Victor Sibu conquered with the state that people like Veronica are contributing to the bad behavior of the youths.
He said a lot of children are behaving strangely these days because of dangerous drugs like Indian hemp.
The Magistrate  therefore said the suspect deserved a stiffer sentence and then ordered her to pay a fine of K60, 000.00 and in default serve a 2 months custodial sentence.

Malawi Police Service faces a lot of challenges which expose the country to continued drug production and trafficking.
Legalise?
In 2000, Deputy Minister of Agriculture Joe Manduwa surprised MPs in the august House when championed Indian hemp’s legalisation.
Manduwa argued that Malawi stood to gain a great deal from cultivating the plant, which he said was a much-sought-after commodity on the world market and could be a valuable alternative to tobacco.
A recent World Bank study says Malawi’s cannabis has a street value of $8.5 million (K1.4 billion) – about 0.2 percent of the country’s GDP.
“Since Malawi farmers receive only about a fifth of the price for which it’s being sold on foreign consumer markets, the positive effect of the production of cannabis on the overall Malawi economy is negligible,”says the Bank in a study done in last year.

Conviction upheld but reduced to 3 months
His mother wept uncontrollably after the verdict, and was restrained by court marshals when she was advancing the judge’s bench.
Mother crying uncontrollably
The High Court was the scene of uncontrollable weeping and wailing as she asked the court to jail her instead.
Mussa was on 15 June 2022 arrested for being found with 78 plastic bags of Indian Hemp at his home.
When he appeared before the Court, he pleaded guilty to the offence, which led to the court to sentence him to eight years.
He has over the last few months been seeking the court to quash his conviction and set aside his sentence.
Among others he argued that the Magistrate Court erred in accepting his guilty plea despite indicating in his caution statement, that he was not in possession of the Indian Hemp.
His pro bono lawyers said they would appeal against the ruling.
Some people said it is only the poor who are sent to jail on being found in possession with chamba while the rich and powerful are fined.
